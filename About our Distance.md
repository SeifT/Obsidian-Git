Do I tell her directly that I do not want to keep seeing her anymore?
Or do I just pull myself out without saying anything? Acting busy when she asks to do something together. Being aloof. Keeping it short when I see her.

Big part of me wants to tell her. Why?:
I feel like that will give me more closure. I feel like if I don't close the door, then I will always be waiting for that message from her.

**Question yourself:** 
- Is part of the reason I want to tell her, a desire to "turn her down", after she had done so before?
- Is part of the reason I want to tell her, a desire to confess my feelings for her again? In the senseless hope that it might change things? That she might consider starting over?
