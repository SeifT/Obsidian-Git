# Auto-Numb

**Definition (mine):** A reflex where my brain dampens stress by blunting thoughts/feelings and pushing tasks “to later.” Short-term relief → long-term damage. Related to [[Dissociation]] and maintained by [[Avoidance]].

## What it feels like (subjective markers)
- Mind goes foggy; “it’s fine, I’ll handle it later.”
- I scroll/watch random content without joy; time jump.
- I tell myself I’ll “start after X,” then don’t.

## My common triggers (current)
- Emails/portals about **exams** (registration, failed attempts).  
- **Visa/immigration** paperwork and deadlines.  
- Messages from **parents/family** about studies.  
- Starting **thesis/lab** tasks with unclear first step.  
- Multi-course overwhelm (“6 exams + lab + thesis”).  

## Why the brain does this (function)
Protective short-term **anxiety down-regulation** → avoidance “works,” so it’s repeated. But it steals time, increases consequences, and deepens shame → more Auto-Numb.

## Early warning signs (catch it early)
- Thought: “I’ll just check one video.” “I’ll feel more ready later.”  
- Behavior: tab-hopping, tidying random stuff, re-organizing instead of doing, playing chess, watching Youtube, video games, etc.

## The **Interrupt Kit** (use when I notice Auto-Numb)
1) **Stand up** → **3 slow exhales** (longer out than in) → **cold water** on face/hands (10–20 sec).  
2) **Say out loud:** “Auto-Numb is here. I choose one action.”  
3) Start **5 minutes** on the **next tiny step** (see Start Ritual).

> [!tip] If→Then card (implementation intentions)  
> - **If** I think “later,” **then** I start a **5-minute timer** and open today’s course file.  
> - **If** I feel the YouTube/game pull, **then** I turn on a **10-minute site block** and do **5 minutes** on the task first.  
> - **If** panic/fog spikes, **then** I do **5-4-3-2-1 grounding**, write **one next action**, and start **5 minutes**.

---

## Start Ritual (makes starting automatic)
1) Phone out of reach; only one browser tab + relevant notes open.  
2) Play the same **instrumental track** (conditioning cue).  
3) Timer: **25 min** focus (or **5 min** if I feel “cold”/under-activated).  
4) After timer: 5-minute break → decide to continue or stop (both are allowed).

---

## Daily structure (simple)
- **Alarms:** 09:00, 13:00, 17:00 – title them “Auto-Numb Check: next step?”  
- **One focus block** (50–90 min or 25 + 25): single course/task only.  
- **Admin sprint** (15 min): registrations, emails, bills, visa forms.  
- **Dashboard (1 page only):** today’s 1–3 micro-tasks, next dates, waiting-on list.

### Micro-tasks I can always do (2–10 minutes)
- Send **one** scheduling email (ZSB/Prüfungsamt/supervisor/lab).  
- Register **one** exam or put date in calendar.  
- Solve **one** problem or read **one** page.  
- Write **3 sentences** of thesis (or outline 3 bullets).  
- Pay **one** bill or enable **one** autopay.  
- Tidy **one** surface (desk) for 2 minutes.

> [!example] “Body-doubling” options  
> - Book 1 online focus session/day on 3 days a week (accountability without disclosure).  
> - Or message a friend: “45-min silent video co-work? I’ll do [X].”

---

## Environment design (make numbness harder)
- Default **site/app blocks** weekdays 09:00–18:00.  
- Remove YouTube/game shortcuts from dock/home screen.  
- Single, boring study space; relaxation space elsewhere if possible.  
- One **landing spot** at home (keys/wallet/papers) to reduce chaos triggers.

---

## Relapse plan (because it will happen)
- **Miss once?** Restart at the next alarm.  
- **Miss a day?** Next day starts with **5 minutes**, no guilt.  
- Write one line: “I noticed Auto-Numb after [trigger]. Next time I’ll start with [micro-task].”

---

## Weekly 10-min review (Sun)
- What triggered Auto-Numb most? What interrupt worked?  
- How many **focus blocks** did I complete? (0–7)  
- Did I do **5 micro-tasks** this week?  
- One friction to remove next week (tool, time, environment).

---

## Where to deploy this **now** (anchors)
- **Admin:** book ZSB + Prüfungsamt + potential supervisor + lab (template emails ready).  
- **Study:** pick **one** passable exam; list 7 micro-tasks for the week.  
- **Paperwork:** gather transcript + ID; create visa folder.

---

## Self-talk replacements
- From “I’ll do it later” → “**Five minutes now** buys me calmer later.”  
- From “It must be perfect” → “**Visible > perfect**. One task, then stop.”  
- From “I wasted the day” → “**Reset now**; next 5 minutes count.”
