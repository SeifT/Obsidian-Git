# Avoidance

**One-line:** Anything done *to not feel or face* something—thoughts, feelings, sensations, tasks, or situations.

## Forms it can take
- **Behavioral:** procrastination, canceling, leaving early
- **Cognitive:** over-planning, rationalizing, reassuring loops
- **Emotional/experiential:** numbing out, distraction → see [[Auto-Numb]]
- **Situational:** steering clear of places/people/topics

## Why it’s sticky
- **Immediate relief** → brain tags it as "works"
- **Long-term cost:** anxiety grows, life shrinks, shame cycle

## Quick self-check
- What am I trying *not* to feel/face?
- What value would be served by approaching this 1%?

## Skills that help (menu)
- **Values micro-step:** Turn the task into a **2-minute** action aligned with a value (e.g., “email draft: first sentence”).
- **Time-box the discomfort:** Work for **10 minutes**, stop on purpose, log how it actually felt.
- **Opposite action (gentle):** If the urge is to hide, send a 2-line message instead of the full call.
- **Urge surfing:** Notice → name → breathe until the urge peaks/falls (often < 2 minutes).
- **Make friction honest:** Keep the barrier visible (e.g., “unclear first step”) and solve *that*.

## Experiments
- **If-Then Plan:** *If* I feel the scroll-urge, *then* stand, sip water, and set a 3-minute timer to begin the first micro-step.
- **Approach ladder:** List 5 graded steps toward the thing; do the **easiest** one today.
- **Accountability snapshot:** Send a “start/stop” timestamp to a friend or to a private log.
