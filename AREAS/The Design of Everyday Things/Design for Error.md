**Definition:**  
Design for Error means creating systems that anticipate user mistakes and help prevent, detect, and recover from them gracefully.

**Example:**  
An email app that asks, “Are you sure you want to send without a subject?” when you try to send a message with an empty subject line.

**How to Apply:**

- Anticipate common user errors and build in safeguards (e.g., confirmations, warnings, undo options).
    
- Make error messages clear, constructive, and specific—explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
    
- Allow users to easily recover from errors rather than punishing them or making the error irreversible.
    
- Observe user testing for frequent points of confusion or error, and adjust the design to address them.
