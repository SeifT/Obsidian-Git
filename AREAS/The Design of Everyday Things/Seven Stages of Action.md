**Definition:**  
The Seven Stages of Action is a model by Don Norman describing the steps people go through when interacting with a system, from forming a goal to evaluating the outcome. It helps designers understand user intentions and identify where usability issues may arise.

The stages are:

- **Forming the goal**  
    _Deciding what you want to achieve._  
    (Example: “I want a printed copy of my document.”)
    
- **Forming the intention**  
    _Deciding how you will achieve the goal._  
    (Example: “I’ll print it using the office printer.”)
    
- **Specifying an action**  
    _Figuring out the exact steps or commands to carry out your intention._  
    (Example: “I need to click on ‘File’ then ‘Print’ in the menu.”)
    
- **Executing the action**  
    _Actually performing the step(s) you specified._  
    (Example: Clicking on ‘Print.’)
    
- **Perceiving the state of the world**  
    _Noticing what has changed in the system or environment after your action._  
    (Example: A print dialog pops up, or the printer makes a sound.)
    
- **Interpreting the state of the world**  
    _Making sense of what you perceive to determine if it matches your intention._  
    (Example: Seeing the “Printing” progress bar and understanding that the print job is starting.)
    
- **Evaluating the outcome**  
    _Deciding whether the outcome is what you wanted; did your action succeed?_  
    (Example: Checking if your document actually printed correctly.)
    

**How to Apply:**

- Map your software’s workflows to each stage to ensure nothing is confusing or missing.
    
- Make each step clear and easy to accomplish (e.g., clear buttons, feedback on actions).
    
- Provide clear feedback after every action, so users know what happened.
    
- Help users both _do_ and _understand_—make intentions and results visible.
