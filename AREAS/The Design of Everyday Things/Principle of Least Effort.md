**Definition:**  
The Principle of Least Effort states that people will naturally choose the path or method that requires the least amount of work to accomplish a task.

**Example:**  
Users tend to save frequently used contacts in their phone so they don’t have to type in the full number every time—they want the easiest way to get things done.

**How to Apply:**

- Streamline workflows to minimize the number of steps needed for common tasks.
    
- Provide shortcuts, autofill, and sensible defaults wherever possible.
    
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or extra input requirements.
    
- Observe real user behavior: redesign any process where users seem to struggle, repeat actions, or seek workarounds.
