**Definition:**  
The Design Thinking Process is a human-centered, iterative approach to problem-solving that involves understanding users, redefining problems, brainstorming, prototyping, and testing solutions.

**Example:**  
A team designing a new productivity tool starts by interviewing users to learn their pain points, generates many possible ideas, builds quick prototypes, tests them with users, and repeats this cycle to refine the best solution.

**How to Apply:**

- Start by empathizing: deeply understand your users and their challenges.
    
- Define the core problems clearly.
    
- Ideateâ€”brainstorm a wide range of creative solutions.
    
- Prototype quickly and cheaply to bring ideas to life.
    
- Test prototypes with real users, learn from feedback, and iterate.
    
- Use this as an ongoing mindset, not just a one-time phase.
