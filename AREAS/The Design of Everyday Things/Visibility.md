**Definition:**  
Visibility means that the relevant parts of a system or interface are easily noticeable and accessible, making it clear to users what actions are possible and how to perform them.

**Example:**  
A play button on a music app that is prominently displayed in the center of the screen, making it obvious where to tap to start playback.

**How to Apply:**

- Place key functions (like primary buttons, navigation) in obvious locations.
    
- Use clear labels and icons that are easy to recognize.
    
- Avoid hiding important features in submenus or behind ambiguous icons.
    
- During testing, watch if users “hunt” for functions; if they do, improve the visibility.
