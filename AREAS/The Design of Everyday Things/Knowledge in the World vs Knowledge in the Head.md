**Definition:**  
This concept distinguishes between information available in the environment (**knowledge in the world**) and information users must remember or recall (**knowledge in the head**).

**Example:**  
A subway map posted at every station (knowledge in the world) vs. needing to memorize the subway route (knowledge in the head).

**How to Apply:**

- Provide instructions, labels, cues, or prompts directly in the interface so users donâ€™t have to remember critical information.
    
- Use visible [[affordances]] and [[signifiers]] (e.g., tooltips, placeholder text, examples).
    
- Avoid requiring users to memorize complex processes or sequences; make relevant information accessible where and when needed.
    
- Strive for a balance: reduce reliance on memory but avoid overloading the screen with unnecessary information.
