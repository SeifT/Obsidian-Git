**Definition:**  
Error recovery refers to the ways a system helps users correct or undo mistakes. Error tolerance is about designing systems so that errors are less likely to have serious consequences.

**Example:**  
Allowing users to “undo” an action (like restoring a deleted file from a trash bin) or warning users before they make an irreversible change.

**How to Apply:**

- Provide easy ways to undo or redo actions, especially for risky tasks.
    
- Use confirmations or warnings for destructive actions.
    
- Design forms and processes to validate input and help users fix mistakes before submitting.
    
- Allow for flexible navigation and correction throughout workflows (not locking users into bad choices).
    
- Whenever possible, make system actions reversible or provide a safety net.
