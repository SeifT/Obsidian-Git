**Definition:**  
Slips are errors that occur when a user intends to do one thing but accidentally does another (often due to inattention or habit). Mistakes are errors caused by a flaw in the user’s plan or understanding—doing the wrong thing because of a wrong goal or incorrect mental model.

**Example:**

- **Slip:** Accidentally clicking “Delete” instead of “Save” because the buttons are close together.
    
- **Mistake:** Trying to log in with an email instead of a username because the system didn’t make it clear which is required.
    

**How to Apply:**

- Design interfaces to minimize the chance of slips (e.g., separate critical buttons, provide undo, add confirmation dialogs).
    
- Make system logic and requirements clear to avoid mistakes (e.g., clear instructions, feedback, and constraints).
    
- Help users recover from both slips and mistakes (e.g., easy undo, clear error messages, non-destructive actions).
    
- Test for common errors during usability testing and address their root causes.
