**Definition:**  
Iterative design is an approach where a product is continually improved through cycles of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining.

**Example:**  
A team builds a basic version of an app, tests it with users, gets feedback, and then refines the designâ€”repeating this process several times before the final release.

**How to Apply:**

- Start with simple prototypes or mockups before building the full product.
    
- Regularly gather user feedback and observe real usage.
    
- Make improvements in small steps, testing each change with users.
    
- Expect multiple rounds of revisions, focusing on learning and adapting rather than aiming for perfection in the first attempt.
