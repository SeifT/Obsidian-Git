**Definition:**  
This principle is about balancing the visual appeal of a design (aesthetics) with how well it works (functionality). A beautiful interface is valuable, but it must also be usable and effective.

**Example:**  
A minimalist app with stylish icons and lots of whitespace looks attractive, but if users can’t find important functions because they’re too hidden or abstract, functionality has been sacrificed for looks.

**How to Apply:**

- Prioritize clarity and usability—make sure every aesthetic choice serves the user’s needs.
    
- Use visual hierarchy (size, color, contrast) to guide users to key actions.
    
- Test for both appeal and effectiveness; don’t let decorative elements get in the way of completing tasks.
    
- Find the right balance: make it look good, but never at the expense of easy use.
