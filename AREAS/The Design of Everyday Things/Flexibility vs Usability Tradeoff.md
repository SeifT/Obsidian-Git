**Definition:**  
This principle describes the balance between offering many features (flexibility) and keeping a product simple and easy to use (usability). More flexibility can mean more complexity, which can reduce usability.

**Example:**  
A photo editing app with dozens of advanced tools and settings offers great flexibility, but can overwhelm new users compared to a simpler app with fewer options.

**How to Apply:**

- Prioritize core features; keep the interface clean for the most common tasks.
    
- Use progressive disclosure: hide advanced features behind menus or “advanced” tabs so they don’t clutter the basic experience.
    
- Consider offering beginner and expert modes, or customizable toolbars.
    
- Test with users from different skill levels to ensure the design isn’t too complex for beginners or too limiting for advanced users.
