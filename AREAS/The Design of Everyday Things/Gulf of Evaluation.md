**Definition:**  
The Gulf of Evaluation is the gap between a system’s output (what happens after an action) and the user’s ability to understand whether their goal has been met. It’s about how easily users can interpret the results of their actions.

**Example:**  
After clicking “Send” on an email, the app provides no feedback—so the user isn’t sure if the email was sent, queued, or lost, making it hard to evaluate the outcome.

**How to Apply:**

- Provide clear, immediate feedback after every action (confirmation messages, notifications, visual changes).
    
- Use familiar symbols, messages, and cues to indicate what has happened.
    
- Make status information (like loading bars, “success” messages, errors) visible and easy to interpret.
    
- Test whether users can confidently know the results of their actions without guessing.
