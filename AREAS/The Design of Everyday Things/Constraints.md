Constraints are obstacles to doing things the wrong way, which guide us to the correct path by blocking off the ones that are incorrect. The author suggests four categories, which he means to describe in detail

- **Physical Constraints:** Physical constraints are tangible and rely upon properties of the physical world, and *no special training or advanced knowledge is needed to do things the right way*. 
	- This is mostly true, but even if you block off every wrong option, the user generally has one of his own - to give up and walk away. This happens a lot when it is too difficult to figure out how to do something right.
	- **Example:**  How Legos have pegs and holes that must be fitted together. Intuitively the user knows what to do and the pieces are physically constrained from being used in a wrong way, like putting the pieces together diagonally.
	
- **Cultural Constraints:** Each culture has a set of allowable and expected actions in social situations, which often becomes clear when encountering someone from a different culture. We know how to behave in a restaurant - what is expected and what is unacceptable - and tend to follow these constraints when we enter one that we have not visited before.  
	- Said another way, cultural constraints are not like physical ones in that they are not really constraints, but merely habits.
	
- **Semantic Constraints:** Are suggestions that can be interpreted from a device - which should seem meaningful and sensible to a user who pauses a moment to consider what he will be doing with the device.
	- I find it curious that this is listed as a constraint rather than a [[Signifiers|signifier]].
	- **Example:** You know where to sit on a motorcycle because the seat is padded. You know which way to face because of the windshield and handle. There is no physical barrier to sitting the wrong way.
	
- **Logical Constraints:** A logical constraint uses reasoning about relationships, meaning, or context—not just physical form—to guide correct use. It’s about what _makes sense_ given the situation, sometimes regardless of strict physical prevention.
	- **Example:** “Save” is only enabled if you’ve made changes. The logic of the state (changed vs. unchanged) is the constraint—not something physical.
