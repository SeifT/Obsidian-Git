Signifiers are perceptible cues that designers include in (e.g.) interfaces so users can easily discover what to do. Signifiers optimize [[Affordances]].


Affordances can be problematic when:

- A perceived affordance is misleading.
- People can't detect the anti-affordance.

We use signifiers to specify *how* people should interact with an object based on its natural affordance.

# How to use Signifiers Best
- Clearly indicate where and how people should interact with your website, including the *gesture* they should use. Is it click, tap, slide, pinch?
- Use Signifiers consistently. Inconsistent use of signifiers can lead to user frustration.
