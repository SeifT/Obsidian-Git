**Definition:**  
Consistency means keeping similar elements and behaviors uniform throughout your interface. Standards refer to following commonly accepted design conventions so users can rely on familiar patterns.

**Example:**  
Using a trash can icon for “delete” across your app, just like most other apps do, and keeping button styles the same on every screen.

**How to Apply:**

- Use the same colors, fonts, icons, and terminology for the same types of actions or objects.
    
- Stick to platform or industry conventions whenever possible (e.g., navigation bar at the top, “X” to close).
    
- Make sure similar actions look and behave the same throughout your product.
    
- Test for confusion: if users expect something to work a certain way, align your design with those expectations.
