**Definition:**  
Feedback loops are responses or signals given by a system that inform users about the results of their actions, helping them understand what’s happening and what to do next.

**Example:**  
When you press a button in an app and it visually changes (highlights, animates, or shows a loading spinner), you know your action was registered and something is happening.

**How to Apply:**

- Provide immediate, visible feedback for every user action—button presses, data entry, submissions, etc.
    
- Use different types of feedback (visual, audio, haptic) as appropriate.
    
- Make sure error states and successes are clearly indicated (e.g., “Saved successfully,” “Invalid password”).
    
- Test for points where users feel “lost” or unsure, and add feedback at those moments.
