**Definition:**  
Discoverability refers to how easily users can find and understand the possible actions and features within a system or interface, even if they’ve never used it before.

**Example:**  
A navigation drawer in a mobile app that slides out when the user taps a clearly marked menu icon (“hamburger” icon) reveals additional options, making features easy to discover.

**How to Apply:**

- Use intuitive icons and labels to guide users toward hidden or secondary functions.
    
- Offer tooltips, hints, or brief onboarding tutorials to introduce less obvious features.
    
- Group related actions together logically, so exploring one feature leads users to discover others.
    
- Keep the most important and frequently used features up front, while still making advanced options findable through cues.
