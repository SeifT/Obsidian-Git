**Definition:**  
The Paradox of Choice is the idea that giving users too many options can lead to overwhelm, decision fatigue, and less satisfaction with their choices.

**Example:**  
A software with dozens of themes, layouts, and customization options may cause users to spend more time choosing and feel less happy with their final selection than if they had just a few curated options.

**How to Apply:**

- Limit choices to what’s most useful or relevant for users.
    
- Group options into categories, or offer recommended/default choices.
    
- Use progressive disclosure—show advanced options only when needed.
    
- Test if users feel overwhelmed or indecisive, and reduce clutter accordingly.
