**Definition:**  
The Gulf of Execution is the gap between a user’s goal/intention and the actions required to achieve it in a system. It describes how easily users can figure out how to do what they want to do.

**Example:**  
A user wants to save their work in a new app but can’t easily find the “Save” button or understand which icon represents saving—so they feel lost trying to accomplish their goal.

**How to Apply:**

- Make sure users can easily determine how to perform desired actions (e.g., clear buttons, obvious icons, familiar controls).
    
- Use language and symbols that match user expectations.
    
- Minimize the number of steps required to complete common tasks.
    
- Test with users: ask them to accomplish tasks and watch where they struggle to translate intent into action.
