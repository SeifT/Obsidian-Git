# Key Concepts
An **affordance** is the characteristic of an object that defines if and how it can be interacted with.
It is not a *property* of the object, rather a relation between the user and the object.
E.g.: A door **affords** opening if the user can reach the handle. For a toddler the door does not **afford** opening, because they cannot reach the handle.

*“When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking: no picture, label, or instruction needed.”*
-Don Norman

Don Norman defines affordances as the actions perceived as possible by the user. This depends on the physical and perceptual constraints of the user, in relation to the object.
The goal is to identify the affordance of an object and increase its affordance.


The concept that makes affordances more or less perceivable, is [[Signifiers]].

For example, a painted zebra stripe in the side of a road is a signifier, a signal about where to walk. It is telling you where it is safe to walk. However, you can walk anywhere on the road - there are no affordances stopping you.

In user interface (UI) design, other main affordances include:
- **Pattern** – You follow conventions to prompt users to take actions – e.g., hamburger icons indicate menus.
- **Negative** – You block users from proceeding towards a goal when they must provide more data – e.g., a greyed-out “Create account” button remains until users complete the form.


# How to Design Better Affordances
1. **Understand your users best through UX research – especially how they’ll anticipate affordances in the unique settings/context of encountering your design. Leverage these insights to provide the best clues to users, who will expect to find obvious cues to perform tasks.
    
2. **Use design principles to create logically arranged, clear affordances without clutter** – so users can _intuit_ what functions of your graphic user interface each affordance controls.
    
3. **Use signifiers to direct users to affordances** – Wherever you can’t make affordances obvious due to color constraints, etc., mark the affordance (e.g., highlight, shadow) or write text on or near it to guide users as to what they should do.
    
4. **Follow conventions so users recognize affordances** – E.g., “Search” in search boxes.
    
5. **Apply [[Fitt's Law]] to help guide users’ judgments and actions** – Since this law establishes that users make more mistakes when moving quickly at smaller targets that are farther apart, help users by (e.g.) making large command buttons to show them priorities.
    
6. **Exploit Material Design– With Google’s Android-oriented design language, you can leverage cue-rich features and natural motions to support onscreen touch experiences. Customize icons to meet users’ expectations best as you present your brand.
