**Definition:**  
User-Centered Design (UCD) is an approach that prioritizes the needs, preferences, and limitations of end users at every stage of the design and development process.

**Example:**  
Designing a photo editing app by involving target users in prototyping sessions, gathering feedback, and iterating the interface to ensure itâ€™s intuitive for both beginners and experts.

**How to Apply:**

- Involve real users early and often through interviews, usability testing, and feedback loops.
    
- Create user personas and scenarios to guide design decisions.
    
- Prioritize solving real user problems rather than assuming what users need.
    
- Iterate design based on user feedback, not just internal opinions or trends.
