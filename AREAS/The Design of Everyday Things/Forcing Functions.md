**Definition:**  
Forcing functions are design elements that prevent users from taking an action (or require them to complete a specific step) in order to reduce errors or enforce necessary behavior.

**Example:**  
A car won’t shift out of park unless the driver’s foot is on the brake—a physical forcing function that prevents accidents.

**How to Apply:**

- Use confirmations or required fields before allowing users to perform critical actions (e.g., “Are you sure you want to delete this file?”).
    
- Design workflows that require users to complete necessary steps in order (e.g., filling all required form fields before submission).
    
- Physically or digitally disable actions that shouldn’t be possible at certain times.
    
- Use forcing functions thoughtfully to prevent mistakes but avoid unnecessary frustration.
