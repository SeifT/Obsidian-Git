**Definition:**  
Skeuomorphism is a design style that mimics real-world objects or textures to make digital interfaces more familiar (e.g., a notepad app that looks like a paper notebook). Flat design removes these real-world references in favor of simple, minimalist, and two-dimensional elements.

**Example:**

- **Skeuomorphism:** A calendar app with pages that look like real paper and tabs.
    
- **Flat Design:** A calendar app with simple squares, bold colors, and icons, without any attempt to look like paper.
    

**How to Apply:**

- Choose a style that fits your users and goals: use skeuomorphic elements to make unfamiliar interfaces more intuitive (especially for new users), or flat design for modern, clean aesthetics and efficiency.
    
- Ensure that essential controls are clear and discoverable, regardless of style—don’t rely solely on real-world metaphors.
    
- Combine the best of both: use subtle skeuomorphic cues where they aid understanding, but keep overall clutter minimal.
    
- Consistency is key; don’t mix the two styles randomly.
