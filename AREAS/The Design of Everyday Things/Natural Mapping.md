**Definition:**  
A Mapping is the relationship between the elements of two sets of things. The relationship between a control and it’s results are easiest to understand when there is an understandable mapping between the control and it’s results.
Natural mapping means arranging controls, buttons, or interface elements so their position and movement intuitively correspond to their effects or outcomes in the real world.

**Example:**  
Stove burners with control knobs arranged in the same pattern as the burners themselves—so it’s obvious which knob controls which burner.

**How to Apply:**

- Arrange buttons, sliders, or controls in a way that visually matches their function (e.g., left/right arrows for navigation).
    
- Use spatial relationships—put related items together, or place controls close to the objects they affect.
    
- In software, mirror real-world processes or physical layouts when possible.
    
- Test prototypes: see if users can predict what will happen when they use a control without explanation.
