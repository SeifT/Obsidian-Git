"From 1810, article 64 states that there is neither crime nor offense if the offender was of unsound mind at the time of the act.
The possibility of ascertaining madness was, therefore a quite separate matter from the definition of an act as a crime; the gravity of the act was not altered by thee fact that its author was insane, nor the punishment reduced as a consequence; the crime itself disappeared. It was impossible therefore, to declare that someone was both guilty and mad; once the diagnosis of madness had been accepted."

- What is the risk that comes with this? Freeing a sane impostor, to save a minuscule minority of insane people from incarceration?
