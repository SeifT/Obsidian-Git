# Interesting Facts and My Own Input
- The clitoris is much larger than people think. And penetrative sex feels good for women because the clitoris is also stimulated. It just doesn't feel as good as direct clitoral stimulation.
- Hysteria used to be a medical diagnosis for women, believed to be caused by a lack of "joining with a male" or bearing a child". Women would then exhibit symptoms such as anxiety, shortness of breath, fainting, nervousness. There was also the idea of a "wandering womb". The medical procedure to solve this problem is called "hysterectomy" (removal of the uterus).
- The word "Scheide" goes back to sword sheath. So the Scheide is basically the cover where a "sword" belongs. The Scheide is the cover where a penis belongs.
- The first sexual experience for most boys is alone, masturbating. The first sexual experience for most girls/women is with someone else, through sex. It's like trying to learn how to ride a bike for the first time. But instead of having to worry about only your own balance, falling, or speed, you have another person on the same bike. You have to try to balance simultaneously, dealing with each other's weight, your different fears.

- "Freud ist ein Arsch." That the idea that female orgasms need to come from penetrative sex comes from him
- what is sex? Why is the status quo, that sex only means sex when PIV is involved
- About hysteria: Female hysteria used to be a medical condition. Now the word is used to describe any person feeling uncontrollable emotions, panic, or fear. The word comes from the ancient Greek **“hystera” (ὑστέρα)** = uterus or womb. How can a word that describes uncontrolled emotion and panic, in a pejorative way, still be tied to the female sexual organ?
- On porn. She mentioned the focus of most porn on male pleasure, whereas the woman just lies there like a doll and makes sounds. This is somewhat true. Though there has been an increase in "feminist" porn. I don't like that expression. Porn that focuses more on the female pleasure, or mutual pleasure. Still, in the majority of porn I see, there is an insane focus on the male orgasm. The "hotspots" of videos are very often the male ejaculation. Usually on the back, face, mouth of whatever else part of the woman. That's nasty. Why would any heterosexual man enjoy seeing that anyway? Regardless, while that is very critical, I think generally speaking the preconceptions porn creates of sex are very troublesome. I consume mostly porn that focuses on female pleasure. And still I think the porn that I watch is harmful to my sexual health. What could the solution be?
- "Es gibt keine Männer, die sich mit ihrer Sexualität auseinandersetzen." I don't really know what she means. What should men do that they do not?
- "Du schreibst, dass nachgewiesen wäre, dass Frauen das lustvollere der beiden Geschlechter sei. Und das Frauen nicht für längere Zeiten der Monogamie geeignet seien... Dass Frauen super schnell, innerhalb von wenigen Jahren das Interesse an ihrem Langzeitpartner verlieren. Während
