Been making an issue out of the whole Hanna thing in my head. Just to have a distraction from my real problems.

Been really ignoring my problems generally. Pushed everything into the back of my head. Would go into [[auto-numb]] mode all the time.

Convinced myself that everything will be just fine. Went into the exact same patterns I used to go into every year. Procrastination and living in the present, with no regard to the future.

The lying is one of the biggest mistakes I ever made. At the time it didn't seem like it would have many consequences. But it turned into hell for me.
I need to take more care about these kinds of decisions.
I learned now that lying is the worst.

I have been running away from my problems.
[[Dissociation]] lead to [[avoidance]].

I have not been able to enjoy the vacations I take because I believe I don't deserve them. I didn't deserve them. Because I wasn't actually putting in work. 

What I need to be doing:
Instead of a 3/10 constant work ethic and 3/10 enjoyment of free time and vacations, 9/10 work ethic and 9/10 enjoyment of vacations.
In order for a 9/10 work ethic to be possible I need to get some things in order:
Motivation. 20 minutes every morning to outline what my motivation is (both for the day, and big picture). Separate it into two catalysts: Volition-based catalysts and stress-based catalysts.
On days where I am not able to fo find the motivation to even do the 20 minutes, make sure to do one in the evening.
