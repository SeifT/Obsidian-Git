**Capture in one location.**

**Capture like a Curator**
Unless we make conscious, strategic decisions about what we consume, we’ll always be at the mercy of what others want us to see.
Instead, adopt the mindset of a curator – objective, opinionated, and reflective.
As you come across social media updates, online articles, and podcasts
throughout your day, instead of diving in immediately, save them for future
consideration. As you begin to collect content, you’ll be able to choose which
sources to consume in a deliberate way

"By training ourselves to notice when something resonates with us, we can improve not only our ability to take better notes, but also our understanding of ourselves and what makes us tick."
