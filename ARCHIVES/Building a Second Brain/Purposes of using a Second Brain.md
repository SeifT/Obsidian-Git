- making ideas concrete
		Offloading ideas from the brain to the concreteness of written text, in order to work with them from an external source (physical written word), rather than an internal source (brain)
- revealing new associations between ideas
		Use the capability to shuffle idea orders and view them in relation to each other.
		Form connections between existing ideas and form new ones
- incubating our ideas over time
		The chances that an idea I come up with at any given moment where a solution is required is the optimal solution is not very high. By constantly storing ideas and knowledge, I have a full pool of present and past knowledge to draw from
- sharpening our unique perspectives
		Did not really understand Tiago's point here and I don't think it's a strong one anyway
