This is a multifaceted financial decision that hinges on a number of factors: your risk tolerance, financial goals, market predictions, and the need for liquidity. Here's a breakdown of your options with an analysis of each:

* * *

### **1\. Sell the house for 12m EGP**

#### **a. Buy a different house somewhere else**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Diversifies your real estate portfolio if you purchase outside Egypt.
    *   Potential for better returns in a more stable economy.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Real estate in stable economies is generally expensive, and liquidity may still be tied up.
    *   Selling and buying property incurs additional costs like taxes, agent fees, etc.

#### **b. Buy real estate in Europe**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Safer asset in a stable economy.
    *   Potential for rental income in hard currency.
*   **Cons:**
    *   High entry costs (e.g., taxes, legal fees, renovation).
    *   Lower yields on rental properties compared to emerging markets like Egypt.
    *   Managing foreign property could be challenging if you’re not in Europe.

#### **c. Put the money in a bank in Egypt at 23% interest**

*   **Pros:**
    *   High nominal returns in EGP terms.
    *   Immediate monthly liquidity (~230k EGP).
    *   Opportunity to convert interest into hard currency.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Inflation risk erodes the real value of EGP.
    *   Risk of further devaluation could negate the benefits.
    *   You remain tied to the Egyptian banking system and its risks.

#### **d. Put the money in a bank in Dubai at 5% interest**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Dollar-denominated returns protect against devaluation.
    *   Dubai banks offer more stability compared to Egyptian banks.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Lower nominal return than Egypt.
    *   You would need a large principal sum to generate significant monthly income.

#### **e. Use a portion for a more risky investment (e.g., S&P 500)**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Long-term growth potential of the stock market (~7-10% historically for S&P 500).
    *   Diversifies your investment portfolio.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Market volatility could lead to losses, especially in the short term.
    *   Requires financial knowledge or reliance on advisors.

* * *

### **2\. Keep the house**

#### **a. Finish and furnish, then rent it**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Passive income in EGP.
    *   Potentially shields against inflation by tying wealth to a tangible asset.
*   **Cons:**
    *   High upfront cost for finishing and furnishing.
    *   Rent may not offset inflation or provide a substantial return if the market is oversupplied.

#### **b. Keep it unfinished and wait for better times**

*   **Pros:**
    *   No additional costs incurred immediately.
    *   Potential for appreciation if the market improves.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Opportunity cost of tying up 12m EGP in a stagnant asset.
    *   Market conditions may worsen before they improve, especially with economic uncertainty in Egypt.

* * *

### **Analysis**

1.  **Risk Assessment:**
    
    *   Keeping wealth tied to the Egyptian economy has high risks due to inflation and currency devaluation.
    *   Diversifying outside Egypt (e.g., real estate in Europe or USD-based investments) reduces this risk but may involve lower nominal returns.
2.  **Liquidity Needs:**
    
    *   If you need regular income, the 23% bank interest in Egypt is tempting but risky in terms of currency stability. Converting interest into USD monthly could hedge against inflation.
    *   Dubai's 5% bank interest is safer but provides lower monthly liquidity.
3.  **Real Estate vs Financial Instruments:**
    
    *   Real estate in Egypt (rented or not) ties you to the local economy, which is currently unstable.
    *   Financial instruments like S&P 500 offer diversification and long-term growth but come with market risks.

* * *

### **Recommendation**

Given your concerns about Egypt's economy and market stagnation in the development project:

1.  **Sell the house** to unlock the value and avoid tying wealth to an uncertain market.
2.  **Diversify:**
    *   Place a majority (~70%) of proceeds in a Dubai USD account (safer hard currency returns).
    *   Use 20% in global equities (e.g., S&P 500) for growth.
    *   Keep 10% as cash or near-liquid assets for short-term opportunities or emergencies.
3.  Consider keeping a smaller portion in Egypt for high-interest earnings but only if you're disciplined about converting it into USD monthly.

If we sell the house for 12m EGP and put the money in Dubai as USD:
- 12m EGP ≈ 235000 USD today
- Place majority (2350000 × 70% = 164500 USD) in Dubai bank.
- Use (235000 × 30% = 70500 USD) in global equities. For example S&P 500:
	- S&P 500 ~7-10% growth historically
	- 70500 × 7%  (lower bound performance) = 4935 USD ≈ 251685 EGP today

This way, we have the added security of having the money in hard currency (USD), while getting ROI similar to what Egyptian banks are offering, **if** S&P 500 projection is accurate

164500 USD in bank × 5% = 8225 USD.
70500 USD in global equities × 7% = 4935 USD
8225 USD + 4935 USD = 13160 USD ≈ 671160 EGP today in annual profits
