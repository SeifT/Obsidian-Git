1. **Skill Books**
    
    - Combine a spell scroll with a blank spell book of the same school to create a skill book.
    - If either spell requires a Source Point, the resulting skill book will also require one.
2. **Combination Skills**
    
    - Combine two skill books from different schools to create hybrid spells (e.g., _Blood Storm_ - Necromancer + Hydrosophist, _Sabotage_ - Scoundrel + Pyrokinetic).
3. **Glowing Idol of Rebirth**
    
    - Obtain the Ashen Idol of Rebirth in Act II (via quest or pickpocketing).
    - Combine with a Resurrection Scroll to create the Glowing Idol of Rebirth, which auto-resurrects you on death.
    - _Tip_: Avoid placing the idol in a backpack due to a bug that prevents it from being consumed and duplicates it.
4. **Snow Shoes**
    
    - Combine nails with any footwear for permanent immunity to slipping on icy surfaces.
5. **Poison Weapons**
    
    - Combine any weapon with a barrel of poison to permanently add poison damage.
    - _Tip_: Poison damage heals undead and does not apply to wands.
6. **Attar of the Blood Rose**
    
    - Combine the Blood Rose (found in Radhikaâ€™s cave in Act I) with an empty potion bottle to create the Attar of the Blood Rose.
    - Grants +1 to all attributes until death.
    - _Tip_: Respec at the Act II mirror removes this buff.
7. **Charm Arrows**
    
    - Combine an arrowhead with honey or a beehive to create charm arrowheads.
    - Beehives provide infinite nectar for crafting.

    - Combine nails with any hammer (not just a repair hammer) or soap with a key to create 4 lockpicks.
9. **Potion Mixing**
    
    - Combine multiple minor healing potions to create medium, large, or huge potions.
    - Augmentor plants can upgrade potions:
        - Minor + Augmentor = Medium
        - Medium + Augmentor = Large
        - Large + High-Quality Augmentor = Huge
        - Huge + Ultimate-Quality Augmentor = Giant
10. **Prankster Poison**
    
    - Combine red dye with a poison flask to make it appear as a healing potion.
    - _Tip_: Plant the fake potion on your co-op partner using Thievery for extra fun.
