# Dissociation

**One-line:** A protective *disconnection* from thoughts, feelings, body, or surroundings when things feel too much.

## What it is
- A **continuum**: from mild "zoning out" to stronger detachment (time gaps, unreal/floaty feeling).
- Usually **protective**, not malicious. It reduces perceived threat by reducing *contact*.

## How it shows up (common signs)
- Blanking on what was just said / "time skipped"
- Body feels far away or heavy; emotions go flat
- Vision tunnels; sounds feel muffled
- Doing tasks on autopilot; later not remembering details

## Triggers & contexts
- Sensory overload, intense emotion, conflict
- Exhaustion, hunger, low blood sugar, dehydration
- Places, dates, or themes that echo old stress

## Early warning signals
- Subtle fogginess
- Losing thread of a sentence
- Micro-freeze in the chest/shoulders
- Urge to stare/scroll/withdraw → see [[Avoidance]]

## What it’s trying to do (the function)
- Create **distance** so you can keep going
- Buy time when there’s no safe, immediate action

## When it helps / when it hurts
- **Helps:** short, situational cooldown
- **Hurts:** becomes default; blocks connection, memory, values-aligned action

## In-the-moment supports
- **Orienting:** Name 5 things you see, 3 sounds, 1 scent.
- **Temperature:** Cool water on wrists/face or hold something warm.
- **Grounding move:** Press feet into floor; slow neck/shoulder rolls.
- **Breath:** 4s in / 6–8s out for 1–2 minutes.
- **Label:** “This is dissociation doing its job.” Then choose a tiny next step.

## Longer-term experiments
- **Body budget:** Sleep, protein, hydration, daylight walks.
- **Gentle exposure to safe intensity:** Tiny doses of feelings + grounding.
- **Trackers:** Note time, trigger, intensity (0–10), and what helped.
