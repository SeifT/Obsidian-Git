Musk is trying to invest more in the US because the chinese EV market is very strong, Tesla Sales rely heavily upon China as a market. He wants to hedge his bets and decrease dependency on China by supporting and investing in the US, and creating a larger presence and market there. Last part may be a stretch though, since Tesla sales have crashed since Musk's heavy and controversial appearances related to the US.

What an L take. Tesla's sales overall have dipped significantly since then. Would have to be the dumbest business play ever.

Islamic Ontology fostered by Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd

Documentation in the Arab World: Less, because of less funding into research infrastructure and partly systems of censorship and as bith a cause and a result, limited data

What exactly is Ontology? What is Ontology?

So look at me running in circles with thoughts about things. This hour makes me probably like 10% as contemplative as Nikola Tesla, Einstein, Newton... 
Is this what makes people interesting. Have I been wasting my time with stupid shit that makes me boring af? if so, maybe I should change tha

Ibn Sina 3amal eh fil Islamic Ontology?

[[Questions for the Round]]

Is the mind and the body two different kinds of beings (substances)?

Descartes made the ontological concept of dualism. (mind and body exist as different substances.) For his system, he allows for the conjecture, that the mind is not is not bound by physical substance. Therefore it is not bound by physical laws. Therefore it can exist after death.

Metaphysical Theology. What lead me here: ibn Sina's ontology was inseparable from metaphysical theology (Necessary Existent = God)

We call it Islamic Ontology not because it's just about Islam, but because it's coming from an Islamic 
*I*ntellectual Ecosystem.


How Ontology describes two different fields (one philosophical, one scientific) under the same name.
Computational vs Philosophical Ontology.
Computational: Assigning 

Asking the right questions to get to the essence of a person. And how to do that without them noticing (with them keeping their guard low)

my usage of gpt. I write down my thoughts and let it answer me. I do not give myself a chance to answer for myself. This dilutes my identity to whatever gpt is trained on as cultural, societal consensus.

[[Where does entitlement come from]]

I wrote all of these notes on my thoughts about the book "Toxic Femininity". It lead to a lot of self reflection, which feels great afterwards, therapeutic. Thing is: Right now this is not a priority in my life. It's very cool and very important to think about this, big picture, but I have a lot of issues right now which are more short term that I need to work on and write about. With the book I had a canvas to draw my thoughts from. So it made it a lot easier. I definitely notice this effect books have on me. When I read something specific, it has a deep but nuanced effect on my daily handling. So if I read a romantic novel, I feel and act more flirty for example.
The issues I am currently having are to do with studies and career. I am really struggling on that front and it is negatively affecting all kinds of other aspects in my life.
I think the main issue is my work ethic. I don't know if it's because of my (undiagnosed) adhd tendencies or because of the situation being really tough, but I can't find the motivation and discipline to power through and work hard. I sporadically get a day where I'm very motivated, but then 3 days where I feel like the task is impossible, succumb to the pressure and end up doing nothing
I have tried a lot things but right now, I feel like a good idea is writing notes and internalizing everything. Why I feel this way, how I can fix it, etc.
And also maybe read a book to supplement it. I kind of hate self help books tbh. What would the equivalent of "Toxic Femininity" the book be, for the problem that I am facing? Like a scientific book on why the brain ticks that way, maybe? Or something else? Please recommend.


Ask if there is a similar arabic quote like the one by Herman Melville.

Is there a way to automate linking and tagging my Obsidian notes?
