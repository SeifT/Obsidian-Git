In my opinion the most accurate definition of a DS Connector is by Otto et al. (2022):
"The Connector ensures that participants maintain sovereignty over the data. At the same time, it functions as an interface between the internal systems of the IDS participants and the IDS ecosystem itself."
I can assume that by "maintaining data sovereignty" they mean it is maintained through the enforcement of data usage policies.

One example of a Data Space Connector is the [[EDC (Eclipse Data Space Connector)]]
