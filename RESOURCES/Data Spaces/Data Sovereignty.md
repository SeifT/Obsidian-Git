Many different definitions and not clearly defined for different contexts.
Definition depends on agents, contexts, values, descriptions, challenges and management strategies.

***Contexts***
- **Legislation**: Data Sovereignty concerns legislation in many cases, i.e. laws limiting cross-border transfer 
- **IT architecture**: The enhanced access to IT infrastructures can be classified as Data Sovereignty. Companies are not limited by infrastructure limitations and therefore are more sovereign in dealing with the data.
- **Research:** In research, Indigenous data sovereignty demands that research practices must be transparent about how data is stored, governed, and used
- **Societal Discourse**: Data Sovereignty gestures towards societal discourse and advocacy. Develop principles that explore the possibilities of common-held data, rather than the privatization of data.
***Values***
- **Power and Control:** The ability or entitlement to steer data flows and/or to govern informational resources. 
	 *Example*:  The insured person has extensive control over his/her health data to be processed in the electronic health card or the telematics infrastructure. 
- **Privacy and Constraining Workflows:** Constraining accessibility of information to others.
- **Deliberation, Representation and Inclusion:** data sovereignty results from and requires particular modes of deliberation and representation that purposefully include a variety of stakeholders.
		*Example:* The development of principles that explore whether the emergent value of data should be held in common rather than privatized
- **Ownership:** Data Sovereignty is sometimes related to the ownership of data.
		*Example:*  The doctor creating the medical data or the hospital storing them are not the owners of this information. Indeed, all medical information belongs to the patient. Consequently, patients have control over their data and the access to this information

***Summarizing*** (Short definition of Data Sovereignty)
Data sovereignty refers to the concept of maintaining meaningful control, ownership, and other claims over data. It often encompasses normative values such as privacy, inclusivity, deliberation, and the recognition of fundamental rights, and applies to a range of agents from individuals to nations. The idea underscores the importance of defining clear rights and abilities related to data governance while addressing challenges like jurisdictional conflicts, technological complexities, and legislative gapsâ€‹
