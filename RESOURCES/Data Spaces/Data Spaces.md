Infrastructure through which multiple participants in the Data Space can exchange data securely.
The merits are:
- Governance of data usage in the DS
- Cataloging of available data, which makes a lot of data ready to exchange for participants
- Use of a [[Clearing House]] to log and audit all transactions in the DS
- Existence of the DS as a decentralized platform, not owned or controlled by any single entity
- Data owners maintain [[Data Sovereignty]] over their data
- Interoperability of data with different formats or structures

The core component of a Data Space is the [[Data Space Connector]].
