Ibn Sina: the world has always existed, for eternity, alongside God 
Al Ghazali: 
a) refutes because of the Islamic belief of the conception of the world from nothing at a certain point of time.
b) because if so, then God didn't choose creation, creation would be necessary, not voluntary. And Al Ghazali insists that God is a willful being, and chose to create the world.





Ibn Sina: الله يعلم الكليات لا الجزئيات
God knows the general universal laws of reality but not every little detail that happens.
His argument: If God's knowledge included particulars, his knowledge would change as events change, which would mean that God is affected by time. He basically argues for the immutability/perfection of God.

Al-Ghazali:
God is omniscient. God knows all things, both universals and particulars.
يَعْلَمُ خَائِنَةَ الأَعْيُنِ وَمَا تُخْفِي الصُّدُورُ



Ibn Sina:
Spiritual/Intellectual afterlife. The soul gets separated from the body in the afterlife.
Al-Ghazali:
This contradicts Islamic Core doctrine of body insurrection. That on the day of Judgement, bodies will be reunited with their souls.
