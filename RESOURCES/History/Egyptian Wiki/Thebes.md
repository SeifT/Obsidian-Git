- **Thebes** was Egypt’s religious/political heart during the Middle & New Kingdoms.
- Lost prominence as trade shifted north toward the **Mediterranean**.

**Why did Cairo and Alex get built to metropoles, while Thebes ended up as mainly a tourist hotspot?**
- [[Alexandria]] founded 331 BCE by Alexander the Great) became key under **Greeks & Romans**—major port, cultural hub.
- [[Cairo]] rose with Islamic conquest (641 CE) and Fatimid rule (969 CE), strategically located near Nile Delta & trade routes.
- Modern Egypt (esp. under Muhammad Ali, 1800s) centralized power in Cairo.
- **Thebes remained sacred but not strategic**—now an archaeological/tourism site, not a modern urban center.
