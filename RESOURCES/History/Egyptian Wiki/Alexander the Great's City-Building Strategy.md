Content:
Alexander the Great used city-building as a strategic tool for consolidating power, spreading Hellenistic culture, and securing control over his vast empire.

Founded 20+ cities, many named Alexandria, strategically placed near rivers, trade routes, or military outposts (e.g. Alexandria-on-the-Indus, Alexandria-in-Arachosia)

Cities served as garrisons, administrative centers, and cultural outposts of Greek language, architecture, and customs.

Alexandria in Egypt was the most significant: key Mediterranean port, blend of Egyptian and Greek influences, and later home to the famous library and lighthouse.

His strategy promoted cultural fusion ([[Syncretism]]) and helped maintain control across a diverse empire by embedding Greek elites and practices.
