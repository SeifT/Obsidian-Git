Syncretism is the blending of different cultural, religious, or philosophical systems into a new, hybrid form. It often occurs when civilizations interact through conquest, trade, or migration.

Examples:

Greco-Egyptian fusion in Alexandria: The god Serapis combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian deities to appeal to both cultures.

Buddhism in Gandhara (modern Pakistan): After Alexander’s campaigns, local art showed Buddha in Greek-style robes with Hellenistic features—a mix of Indian spirituality and Greek aesthetics.
