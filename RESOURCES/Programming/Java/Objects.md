designed primarily for extensions. Has nonfinal methods: equals, hashCode, toString, clone, and finalize.

These nonfinal methods have *general contracts* because they were designed to be overridden.  It is the responsibility of any class overriding these methods to obey their general contracts; failure to do so will prevent other classes that depend on the contracts (such as HashMap and HashSet) from functioning properly in conjunction with the class.
