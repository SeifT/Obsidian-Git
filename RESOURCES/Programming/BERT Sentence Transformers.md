## Sentence Transformers â€“ Efficient Semantic Embedding

- **Sentence Transformers** (e.g., SBERT) provide an easy and computationally cheap way to generate high-quality semantic vector representations for sentences and short texts.
    
- Useful for:
    
    - Semantic search (finding similar text)
        
    - Text clustering
        
    - Duplicate detection
        
    - FAQ/question matching
        
- Much faster and more lightweight than traditional transformer-based approaches for these tasks.
    
- Great option when needing efficient, scalable NLP solutions for semantic similarity or retrieval.
