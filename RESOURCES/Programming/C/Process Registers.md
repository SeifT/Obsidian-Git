**Process Registers**
Registers are essential components of the CPU that store critical information about the process state. Here are key registers.
1. **Instruction Pointer (IP)** / **Program Counter (PC)**
    - Holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
        
2. **Stack Pointer (SP)**
    - Stores the address of the top of the stack.
        
3. **General Purpose Registers (GP)**
    - Used for storing values or addresses used by instructions.
        
4. **Page Table Pointer**
    - Contains the address of the memory mapping.
        

These registers play crucial roles in managing the execution and memory operations of processes on their respective architectures.
