Western ontologists seem to touch on so many theological and spiritual subjects under the umbrella of ontology, not theology. 
Ontology in the Arabic and Islamic world has always been mainly tied to Islam, led by Ibn Sina and Al-Farabi.
My conclusion was: Western ontologists are basically atheist theologians.

Funny how a field that now powers AI and data modeling was once about souls and substances. Maybe it still is.
