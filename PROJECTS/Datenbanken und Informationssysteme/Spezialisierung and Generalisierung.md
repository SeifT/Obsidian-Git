isA relations.

**Properties:**
- Disjunkt: Cannot be multiple things at the same time. (An employee cannot be an assistant *and* a Professor at the same time.) Arrow points towards the specialization i.e. professor or assistant
- Nicht disjunkt: Can be multiple things at the same time. (A person can be an employee *and* a student at the same time.) Arrow points towards the generalization, i.e. person
- Total (t): The decomposition of the generalization is complete. (A person can only either be alive or dead. Nothing else.)
- Partiell (p): The union of the specializations is a proper subset of the generalization.

Here, the isA relation is total (all of the possible types of Drs are listed) and disjunct (A Dr can only be one type of Dr, not multiple)
