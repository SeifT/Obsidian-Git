06/09: Travel to Aachen
Leave the Studying for the plane and trains mainly. Do not sleep in the plane. Caffeinate throroughly.
Flash cards best for plane.

07/09-11/09: Aachen Bibben
Depending on time of arrival the night before, wake up after 7-8 hours of sleep.
Then 10 hours of bibben. But not wasteful 10 hours. Try to really focus in and use the methods in make it stick.

12/09: DBIS Exam day
Exam is in the morning, so I have the whole day to study again. 8 hours of bibben on this day, instead of 10.

13/09-15/09: Aachen Bibben
Studying for Stocha. 10 hours of bibben a day.

16/09: Stocha Exam day
Exam is in the morning, so I have the whole day to study again. 8 hours of bibben on this day, instead of 10.

17/09-24/09: Aachen Bibben
10 hours a day.

Use 50-minute focus blocks + 10-minute breaks (≈4h net, ~50m breaks). If you want 5h net, add one more block.
**Daily checklist (Keep this fixed):**
1. **Warm-up recall (10 min)**: closed-book, write what you remember from yesterday (all exams).
2. **Spaced review (20 min)**: cards/problems _due today_ (Leitner/Anki or a simple “due” pile).
3. **Four 50-min focus blocks** (interleave across exams as shown below).
4. **10-min reflection**: list today’s 2 biggest errors; schedule them back into your deck.

**Inside each 50-min block (Make-It-Stick style):**
- 5 min: **Predict** (what will be asked; outline from memory).
- 35–40 min: **Retrieval-heavy work** (mixed problems; teach-back; flashcards answered _before_ looking).
- 5–10 min: **Elaborate + log errors** (write “because…”, add one concrete example, tag errors by Concept/Procedure/Careless).

---
# Time allocation by proximity (adjust daily blocks like this)

**Until 9/11 (before Exam A):**
- **A: 50%** (2 blocks/day)
- **B: 25%** (1 block/day, alternate with C)
- **C: 15%** (½–1 block/day via alternating)
- **D: 10%** (end-of-day quick set or cards)

**9/13–9/15 (between A and B/C):**

- **B: 40%**, **C: 40%**, **D: 20%**
    

**9/18–9/24 (after B/C, before D):**

- **D: 70%**, **A/B/C maintenance: 30%** (short mixed recall sets only)
    

> Tip: if one exam is harder, steal 10% from the easiest and give it to the hardest, but keep **all four active daily** (that’s your spacing/interleaving insurance).

# Concrete 7-day opener (Aug 25–31)

**Mon 8/25 (Day 1)**

- Warm-up (10) → Spaced review (20)
    
- **Block 1 (A):** core topics sweep, create “core cards + core problem types”
    
- **Block 2 (B):** teach-back 2 big ideas, add 10 cards
    
- **Block 3 (A):** mixed problems set (not massed), error log
    
- **Block 4 (C/D):** 25m C + 25m D quick wins (definitions, formula sheet)
    

**Tue 8/26**

- Blocks: **A → B → A → C** (D via end-of-day cards 10–15m)
    

**Wed 8/27**

- Blocks: **A → C → A → B**
    
- Add one **10-question mini-quiz** for A (timed, closed-book) inside a block.
    

**Thu 8/28**

- Blocks: **A → B → A → D**
    
- Build one **one-pager** for A from memory (dual coding: small diagram + bullets).
    

**Fri 8/29**

- Blocks: **A → C → A → B**
    
- **A Mini-Mock (30–40 min)** at the start of Block 3 (timed, mixed). Review errors immediately.
    

**Sat 8/30**

- Lighter but still 4h: **A → B → A → C**. Keep **D cards (10–15m)**.
    
- End with **2-minute reflection** writing the 3 patterns in mistakes.
    

**Sun 8/31 (recovery-ish)**

- 3 blocks only (A → B → C).
    
- 20–30 min active rest (walk/stretch). Short **D cards**.
    

> Repeat the **A-heavy rotation** through Thu 9/4. Every other day, start one block with a **timed mixed set** for A.

# Key milestone ladder (all retrieval-focused)

**Exam A (Fri 9/12):**

- **Sat 9/6:** _Full-length mock A_ (in exam conditions). Same day: error-driven fixes.
    
- **Wed 9/10:** _Half-length mixed A_ (target weak areas only).
    
- **Thu 9/11:** _No new A content._ 60–90 min total: spaced review + teach-back. Sleep.
    

**Exams B (Tue 9/16) & C (Wed 9/17):**

- **Fri 9/5:** B & C _mini-mocks_ (30–40 min each, on separate blocks).
    
- **Tue 9/9:** 60-min _B mixed set_. **Wed 9/10:** 60-min _C mixed set_.
    
- **Sat 9/13 or Sun 9/14:** _Full-length B_ (one day) and _Full-length C_ (the other).
    
- **Mon 9/15:** _Half-length B & C_ targeted sets + light review.
    
- **Tue 9/16:** After B, do **30–45 min C recall only** (no new content).
    

**Exam D (Thu 9/25):**

- **Thu 9/18:** _Mini-mock D_ (30–40 min).
    
- **Sun 9/21:** _Full-length D_.
    
- **Wed 9/24:** _Half-length D_ (targeted).
    
- Daily maintenance of A/B/C = 15–25 min mixed recall.

# What to _do_ inside each block (by exam type)

- **Problem-solving courses (calc/physics/programming):**
    
    - 20–30 min **mixed** problems (rotate types A→B→C within the block).
        
    - 10 min **error log rewrite**: for each miss, write the _trigger cue_ (“If the prompt shows ___, I should try ___ because ___”).
        
    - 5–10 min **generation**: attempt a new problem _before_ notes.
        
- **Concept/theory courses (bio/psych/history):**
    
    - 15–20 cards **by idea**, not by chapter (each card = question that forces an explanation).
        
    - 10 min **teach-back** to a blank page including one **edge-case example**.
        
    - 5–10 min **dual coding**: quick diagram/timeline, then redraw from memory later.
        
- **Quantitative with formulas:**
    
    - Build a **“Why it works” deck** (short proofs/intuitions) + a **“When to use” deck** (cue→method).
        
    - Interleave **unit/assumption checks** so it doesn’t become plug-and-chug.

# Spacing you can actually follow

Use this simple ladder for anything you add today: **0 → 2 → 6 → 16 → 35 days**.  
Practically: when you answer a card/problem **correctly**, push it to the next interval; when **wrong/slow**, keep it in the short loop (later _today_ or _tomorrow_). Aim for **150–250 retrieval reps/day** across subjects (cards or problem steps)—within your 4–5h this is very doable.

---

# Interleaving without chaos

- Make a tiny **rotation grid** for each day (12 slots). Example for today:  
    `A1, B1, A2, C1, A3, B2, A4, D1, A5, C2, B3, A6`  
    Each “Ax” is a _different_ topic/type. Shuffle tomorrow.
    
- Never do 20 of the same problem in a row. Cap at **2 in a row**, then switch type.
    

---

# Calibration (so you don’t fool yourself)

- **Every 3 days per upcoming exam:** timed mixed set (15–30 min).
    
- Grade fast. For each error, write 1 sentence: **What cue did I miss? What will I do next time?**
    
- If recall <80% or timing slips, **don’t** increase time; **increase spacing and interleaving** of that weak area.
    

---

# The day before / day of each exam

- **Day before:** 60–90 min total per next-day exam → spaced review + teach-back + 6–8 _mixed_ questions. Stop heavy work **≥12 hours before**.
    
- **Morning of:** 10–20 min **confidence set** (only medium/easy mixed items). No new content.
    

---

# Minimal tools (no fluff)

- **Cards:** physical or Anki; front = _question that forces explanation_, back = _your short, personal answer_ + 1 example + 1 trap.
    
- **Error log:** 5 columns → Topic | What I did | Why wrong | Correct idea | New cue/example.
    
- **One-pagers:** one per big idea; redraw from memory after 48h.

If you drop your four subject names + any topics you fear most, I’ll slot them into this calendar with exact block menus (the mixed sets, mock dates, and card prompts tailored to each exam).
