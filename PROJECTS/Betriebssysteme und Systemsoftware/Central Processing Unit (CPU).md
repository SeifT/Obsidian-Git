A CPU contains the following components:

- Execution units that execute instructions
	- Decoder reads an instruction and forwards to the proper execution unit
	- Arithmetic/Logical Unit (ALU) performs integer and binary operations
	- Floating-Point Unit (FPU) performs floating-point operations
	- Memory Unit (MU) performs memory accesses
- Registers that store data
	- State information, e.g., instruction pointer, stack pointer, return address 
	- Program values in general-purpose registers
- Multiple levels of caches to avoid performing redundant and costly memory accesses
