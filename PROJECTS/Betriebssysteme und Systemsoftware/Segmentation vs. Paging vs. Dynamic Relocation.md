**Paging** and **segmentation** are two fundamental memory management schemes in operating systems. They both translate virtual addresses to physical addresses, but they do so in fundamentally different ways and are designed to solve different problems.
## **Paging**

### **What is it?**

- **Paging** divides the virtual address space of a process into fixed-size blocks called **pages** (e.g., 4 KB each).
    
- Physical memory is divided into **frames** of the same size.
    
- Any virtual page can be placed into any available physical frame.
    

### **How does it work?**

- The OS maintains a **page table** for each process, mapping virtual page numbers to physical frame numbers.
    
- When a process accesses a virtual address, the CPU:
    
    1. Extracts the page number and offset.
        
    2. Looks up the page number in the page table to get the frame number.
        
    3. Combines the frame number with the offset to get the physical address.
        

### **Key Characteristics**

- **Fixed size**: Both pages and frames are of fixed size.
    
- **Eliminates external fragmentation**: Any free frame can be used for any page.
    
- **Can cause internal fragmentation**: Last page of a process may not be full.
    
- **Simple address translation**: Just page table lookup and offset calculation.
    
- **Not aware of logical divisions**: The OS/CPU doesn't know which part of the address space is code, data, stack, etc.—everything is treated uniformly.

## **Segmentation**

### **What is it?**

- **Segmentation** divides the virtual address space into variable-sized **segments** based on the logical divisions of a program (e.g., code, data, stack, heap, shared memory).
    
- Each segment has its own base and length.
    

### **How does it work?**

- The OS maintains a **segment table** for each process, with a **base address** and **length** for each segment.
    
- A virtual address is given as **(segment number, offset)**.
    
- When a process accesses a virtual address, the CPU:
    
    1. Extracts the segment number and offset.
        
    2. Checks if the offset is within the segment length (bounds checking).
        
    3. Adds the offset to the segment’s base physical address to get the physical address.
        

### **Key Characteristics**

- **Variable size**: Each segment can be of different size.
    
- **No internal fragmentation**: Segments fit exactly what is needed.
    
- **Can cause external fragmentation**: Because segments are variable-sized, holes can appear in physical memory.
    
- **Logical divisions**: Supports separating code, data, stack, etc., each in its own segment.
    
- **Protection and sharing**: Easier to set different permissions and share segments.

## **Comparison Table**

|Feature|Paging|Segmentation|
|---|---|---|
|Division|Fixed-size pages|Variable-size segments|
|Fragmentation|Internal (last page)|External (holes in memory)|
|Address structure|(Page number, Offset)|(Segment number, Offset)|
|Logical program structure|Not preserved|Preserved (matches code/data)|
|Table used|Page table|Segment table|
|Protection/sharing|Harder, page-level|Easier, segment-level|
|Example usage|Most modern OSes|Early systems, or MMU features|

## **Address Translation Example**

**Paging**:

- Virtual address: `0x0A27`
    
    - Page number: `2`
        
    - Offset: `0x27`
        
    - Page table: Page 2 → Frame 7
        
    - Physical address: Frame 7, Offset 0x27
        

**Segmentation**:

- Virtual address: (Segment 3, Offset 0x135)
    
    - Segment table: Segment 3 base = 0x8000, length = 0x500
        
    - Physical address: 0x8000 + 0x135 = 0x8135
        

---

## **Summary**

- **Paging**: Hides fragmentation, easy to implement, no logical program structure.
    
- **Segmentation**: Matches program structure, supports protection, suffers from external fragmentation.
    

> **Modern OSes often combine both (segmented paging), but conceptually, they're distinct.**

## **Quick Overview: What is Dynamic Relocation?**

- **Dynamic Relocation** refers to the ability to move a process’s memory image to different locations in physical memory while the program runs, without modifying the program’s code.
    
- Typically, this is achieved using a **base register** (sometimes with a limit register).
    
- Every memory access is **relocated at runtime**: the hardware adds the base address to the program’s address (logical address), turning it into a physical address.

## **How Dynamic Relocation Works (In Detail)**

- Each process has a **base register** loaded with the starting physical address of its memory region.
    
- When the process accesses memory at logical address `X`, the MMU computes `Physical Address = Base + X`.
    
- A **limit register** may be used to prevent out-of-bounds accesses (`X < Limit`).
    
- The OS can move the process by updating the base register (but the process’s address space must be contiguous).
    

---

## **Example of Dynamic Relocation**

Suppose a process has:

- **Base Register:** 3000
    
- **Limit Register:** 500
    

If the program accesses address **100**, the MMU computes:

- **Physical Address = 3000 + 100 = 3100**
    

If the program tries to access address **600**, it is beyond the limit and causes an error.

---

## **Key Differences**

- **Paging** and **segmentation** both provide a way to subdivide the address space and map those pieces to potentially non-contiguous physical memory (helps avoid large holes and fragmentation).
    
- **Dynamic relocation** just offsets the whole address space—**the entire process must be contiguous in physical memory**. This can lead to external fragmentation and makes sharing/growing memory harder.
    
- **Segmentation** and **paging** add another level of indirection with tables; **dynamic relocation** is a simple, direct scheme.
    

---

**In summary:**

- **Dynamic relocation** is a basic form of address translation using a single offset (base), with limits on flexibility.
    
- **Paging** splits memory into equal-sized blocks.
    
- **Segmentation** splits memory into logical, variable-sized segments.
