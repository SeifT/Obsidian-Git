Round Robin:
When a process uses up its quantum at the same time a new process arrives:
New process goes into runqueue first. "Enta lessa la3eb yala"

When a process has a remaining processing time less than the quantum, it gives over the CPU early, without finishing its quantum. "Sooo Feierabend"

Shortest Remaining Time (SRT):
It's preemptive.
