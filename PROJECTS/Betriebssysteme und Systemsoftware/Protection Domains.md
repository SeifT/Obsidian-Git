In order to provide the necessary isolation, operating systems provide diï¬€erent protection domains or modes.

Usually, two protection domains are provided:
- [[Supervisor mode]]
- [[User mode]]

In practice, protection domains are backed by hardware processor privilege levels, also called CPU modes or CPU states.
For example, x86 provides four levels, also called protection rings.
