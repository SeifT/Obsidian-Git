The hybrid kernel architecture sits between monolithic kernels and microkernels.
It is a monolithic kernel where some components have been moved out of kernel space as
servers running in user space.
While the structure is similar microkernels, i.e., using user servers, hybrid kernels do not
provide the same safety guarantees as most components still run in the kernel.

==This architectureâ€™s existence is controversial, as some just define it as a stripped down monolithic kernel.==
