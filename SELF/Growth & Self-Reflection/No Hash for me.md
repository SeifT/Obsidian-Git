When I am with friends:

I get really stupid.
I am uncomfortable 
I get very silent, more than usually 
If I am only high around my friends, they will think I am just always stupid.
Next time I get passed a juju, I will pass. Maybe smoke a normal ciggy instead as stopgap

When I am alone:
It's fun because I think about things differently.
It's tough because of I think about things differently (harsh thoughts)
I get into a deep cycle of isolation and don't feel the need to talk to anyone
I get lazy. Days pass by with nothing accomplished
