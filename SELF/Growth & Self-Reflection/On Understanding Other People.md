Scenario:
Anna sends me the following message:
"How strange. I woke up with a cold and had a nightmare in the morning. And I remember my dreams like once every 6 months. I was supposed to write an essay and have a presentation about George Harrison, his different influences. And then this pops up"

**First Thought**: She is super esoteric. What does the one have to do with the other at all???
Seemed to me like she was drawing at straws trying to connect two things in the name of universal energy.

**Revision of Thought**:
Anna was experiencing [[Apophenia]]. 
When something unusual, such as the dream, coincides with another event in waking life (the GH post), it can feel uncanny.

**Lesson**:
I thought I was a really empathetic person. Someone who understood what others feel and why they feel it, in most cases.
Here I proved myself wrong. And while I don't agree with the premise that Anna set, I did not understand it, or her.

So, think twice when not understanding someone.
