You need to make things right. Work your absolute butt off to get this stuff done.
If you don't there will be hella consequences.
You can't keep up to your lies anymore. This is your last chance

Your parents have invested so much into you. Just for you to be a failure and lie your ass off. Make things right.

When you do, there will be a time where you can spend time with your parents. See them regularly.
