Seeing what other people do constantly can dilute my focus.
It can crowd my inner voice.
I become a consumer of people's lives rather than actively building my own.
*Those* are the psychological costs, not the whole comparison thing people keep talking about.

My principles for not posting:
Impossible to avoid the narcissistic trap when posting. Regardless of what it is I'm posting. Even if it is something I am passionate about. Or some sort of activism, most of the time a big factor for the post or story will be driven by narcissism
