How hard it is for people
How much it saddens me to go back every time. Going back is almost more difficult than it brings me joy.
People are barely surviving.
I was a bit embarassed by myself reading toxische Weiblichkeit. People in Egypt don't have capacities to read and form opinions on big social issues. It's useless information for them. Because nobody will fight for these secondary meeds of social equality, feminism, anti-capitalism when their basic, primary needs are not being met. It's a privilege being able to read about these things, not having to worry about how I'm feeding my family, working 18h a day.


Met Hagg Mohamed today. He is an uber driver. Very respectful man. Also has some gravitas to him.

0 chance to sit down and be with myself. A bit exhausting honestly. I'm very extroverted in Germany, more introverted here.

People who love me around me.

The targeting of ads towards genders.
