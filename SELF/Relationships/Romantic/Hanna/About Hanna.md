She likes me. She just doesn't like when there is pressure.
She has made comments like "es dauert übrigens oft länger für mich bis ich was fühle, als die andere Person", "es ist okay für mich, wenn du andere Leute datest (in an almost encouraging way)", "ich mags nicht, wenn es diesen Druck einer Beziehung gibt. Am besten ist es wenn man sich als Freunde kennt und dann sich was entwickelt"


I am sought after. I am smart, empathetic, look good right now, have an okay sense of humor.
At the GermaBib, girl was checking me out, Katha was looking at me today, swimming girl was looking at me. Remember the Mathebib girl. 
I don't need to feel like I am reaching for Hanna. She is special, but so are many other girls. If I start initiating things I will easily get with someone special this summer, not necessarily Hanna. Maybe she isn't even a good match for me. 

I will just be fun, treat her as someone I enjoy being around, not someone I am auditioning for the role of girlfriend. 
Don't future-trip, or get into too deep relationship talk.
Let her set the rhythm emotionally and physically. Being nonchalant about that can be a great way of having her want it even more when she feels more comfortable.
