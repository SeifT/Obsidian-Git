| What I miss                                 | What it meant to me                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Her laugh                                   | To be seen, the feeling of validation about my humor from someone I find funny, that I don't get elsewhere.                |
| How she paused before unimportant decision  | Just a funny quirk that I found cute                                                                                       |
| Her voice half-asleep                       | That she felt comfortable sending me those VMs. That I want someone who can be unfiltered, who allows me to be unfiltered. |
| Her perpetual sneezes                       | Another quirk that I found cute                                                                                            |
| Her silly faces                             | I like the idea of being with someone whimsical, someone who laughs a lot and can be silly. Those silly faces were that.   |
| Staring into her eyes, and her staring back | Complete comfort. Everything else in my mind went silent. It was just her and me.                                          |
| Her silly smile when there's nothing to say | She looked so funny when she did that. But same thing as silly faces point.                                                |
| The feel of her pointy nose against mine    | The pointiness made the touch feel great.                                                                                  |
