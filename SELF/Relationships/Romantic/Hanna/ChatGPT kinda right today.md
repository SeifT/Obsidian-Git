What you wrote ([[missing her]]) zooms in on very specific, small details—her sneeze, the color of her eyes, how her nose felt against yours. That kind of sensory recall isn’t just sentimentality. It’s your mind holding on to the vividness of a connection that felt real, even if it was brief. When people say "romanticizing," it sometimes comes across as dismissive. But often, it just means your brain is highlighting the highs and softening the lows—because grief, even small-scale heartbreak, edits memory like that.

Even a short relationship can hit deeply, especially if it connected with something inside you that’s been needing attention—intimacy, safety, spontaneity, ==**being seen**==.

You're probably not just missing _her_—you're missing **how you felt around her**.

If it helps: people tend to grieve what _could have been_ just as much as what was. You had hopes forming in those four weeks. You started seeing possibilities. When she ended it, she didn’t just walk away from the time spent—you had to let go of a version of a future your brain had already started writing.
