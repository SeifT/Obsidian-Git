She has issues with commitment. It's a shame. It's okay to feel disappointed.
What is this disappointment and where is it rooted?
Disappointment because of the nice times we had together. Disappointment about the loss of the potential good times ahead. Disappointment because she does not see in me what I see in myself? Do I even see it in myself? Things seemed to be going in another direction than what just happened. So it was a bit surprising. 

It seems men have set a precedent that she cannot get over. I am not sure if she had a traumatic experience or what. 

Her handling of Rebekka was a bit of a red flag. She can seem like a very empathetic person, but that is not necessarily true. She acted as if Rebekka was not good enough for her. And she disguised it under a "misunderstanding".

It is even better that I got to experience this with her. I can learn a lot from this. There was a story to how the thing with Ines happened. There was a story to how things with Hanna happened. 
To me, both experiences were kind of similar. In terms of our time together, it was as much fun with both. However, outside of that is where things were different. Learning Moment: I should have noticed from the beginning that something is off. That she is not as interested as she should be. That she is a skeptical person. Complicated. In future, when I feel like this again, I should distance myself. Or should I talk about it? But talking about it is losing power.


Things she has said that seem like issues:
Her imagination of a relationship model. She believes in monogamy and polygamy. She said that it depends on who she's with. But she finds it quite unlikely to have a monogamous relationship with a man, since she feels like that would be the man forbidding her from having such a relationship. 
She has also said that with sex, that it feels very one-dimensional with most men. That they have this drive that is one-dimensional, as opposed to women. And that she gets turned off whenever she feels like a man wants her sexually. More clearly, she gets turned off, when she thinks that a man wants her in a purely biological, testerone-fueled horniness. Or that's my interpretation at least, she could just get turned off by horny men in general lol.

Honestly to me those just sound like deep rooted issues with men that I have become the collateral of. 

To Hanna (for my notes only):
I never know how much of this kind of talk is true and how much of it is stuff said to soften the blow. I just ask you to try and be as honest as possible.
What I kind of understood about this whole thing is that one big issue is a deep rooted lack of trust for men. You said your gut feeling sensed that something was off, which is fair. Do you think dating men in general is an issue for you right now? To me it feels like you feel like there is so much unknown to you about dating a woman, that you really want to do that before nailing yourself down to a relationship with a man.

You also mentioned the fact that we didn't have sex last time I slept over. I don't know what that is supposed to mean. I think during our talk, you may have indirectly expressed that you did not want to have sex. But on that night I did not really become aware of that. I just thought "oh we're both really tired. Let's just watch a movie and cuddle." Anyway I am usually not someone to judge sex based on one time, especially because I know I have been with only 5 people in the past. So this lack of experience makes sex a nervous thing for me and I don't know how to communicate each of our wants and needs effectively. Anyway I just want to say I am sorry if you felt uncomfortable after we had sex. That was not at all my intention, in any sort of way.

Actually for Hanna (maybe for closure, also for healthy comm):
Ich wollte nur noch kurz klarstellen, was ich mit „Zeit gut nutzen“ gemeint habe. Damit wollte ich auf keinen Fall sagen, dass unsere gemeinsame Zeit nicht gut genutzt war. Wenn ich in die Vergangenheit gehen könnte, würde ich die Zeit mit dir genauso verbringen – selbst mit dem Wissen, dass es vielleicht am Ende nicht klappen wird.  
Mir ging es einfach darum, dass ich mit Menschen, bei denen ich das Potential für eine starke emotionale Bindung sehe, viel mehr Zeit verbringen möchte als mit anderen. Und für mich entsteht so eine starke Bindung meistens nur im romantischen Kontext.

Und noch kurz als zweites: Ich war beim Gespräch etwas zurückhaltend, ein bisschen als Abwehrmechanismus. Dafür wollte ich mich entschuldigen. Mir ist es eigentlich sehr wichtig, immer ehrlich zu sein und keine „Spielchen“ zu machen, aber das fiel mir in dem Moment schwer.  

Und noch als letztes, wegen dem Sex, so wie du darüber gesprochen hast hab ich das Gefühl bekommen dass du dich danach oder deswegen nicht so wohl gefühlt hast. Das war echt nicht meine Absicht, es war vor allem meine Absicht dass du dich wohl fühlst aber vielleicht war dann die Execution nicht gut. Ja mein Punkt einfach es tut mir sehr Leid wenn du negative Gefühle was das angeht hast.

Ich persönlich habe das Gefühl, dass ich jetzt nicht noch mal ausführlich über alles sprechen muss, aber ich wollte dir trotzdem das Angebot lassen: Falls du das Bedürfnis hast, bin ich offen dafür.

Based on her vm, there are only two possible conclusions.
It definitely was not that she felt uncomfortable with me. If anything the opposite. The issue for her seemed to be the night we watched portrait of a lady on fire at her place. That she wasn't sure if she wanted to have sex with me. She did say that she has a reflex where when she feels that a man really wants her sexually, that she gets turned off. And she was very unsure about whether she wanted to have sex that night in general, but maybe that moment when we were making out and I moaned and blew air in her face as an "I want you now" reflex triggered that reflex.


So the first conclusion is that she lost attraction to me. Maybe the attraction wasn't that strong in the first place and that night kinda confirmed to her that it doesn't feel right on a sexual level.
Maybe she didn't like me that much. But that seems like a bit of a stretch, thinking back. She was definitely slightly bipolar in her expression of interest. After one meeting she would be super texty and flirty and all of that. And after another meeting it would seem to me as if her texting me would be difficult for her.
But in general when we were together, there is no denying that she was really into me. Which is what is so **confusing**!
So now that I kind of excluded the romantic interest issue, it was probably a sexual interest issue. 
It could go back to her issues with sex and men. 
Yeah during the vm, she was definitely struggling to get the words out. The exact words that I think would hurt me. She said that it definitely wasn't anything I said or did, nor with feeling comfortable. The only thing that leaves is that she didn't want me enough, probably on a sexual level, possibly also on a romantic level.  

The second possible conclusion is that she was seeing or briefly saw another person, most probably a woman and felt like that is more what she wants in comparison to me. 
What am I saying, these are not two different conclusions, they are the same one. A combination of both things happened and she lost attraction to me. We talked about this before, but it was probably that she thought to herself "oranges Licht" on that night at her place, meaning she was really not sure if she wanted to have sex and to her that was a sign that she should not pursue this. 
I don't know about that tbh, it seems like a very rash decision to me. She has insane standards for herself, for relationships. Idk how she stayed in a 2y relationship with a person she didn't even love. It was an open relationship I guess, so...
Regardless of how much I can see that all of these things are kind of red flags, albeit red flags that she is working on resolving, it is still okay to be sad about losing her. 
I liked her, a lot. In a way I haven't liked anyone before. Maybe that's recency bias, but right now I believe that. And it's still a shame it didn't work out.

"Ob ich Lust auf sex hab oder nicht, und das war nicht konkret auf dich bezogen, sondern allgemein." 

She probably felt safe with me — but safe isn’t always _exciting_ or clarifying for people working through attraction trauma.

She was avoidant on the day of our talk mainly because she was dreading the talk, not because of any negative sentiments directed at me.
She talked to her therapist the day we met. That probably gave her more clarity in order to go through with the breakup.

So the final conclusion is:
That I did absolutely nothing wrong.  She is working out stuff about her sexuality, about her image of a relationship. She might have liked at like 60-70% or whatever and that wasn't enough to sacrifice her figuring shit out. 
TODO: She never did say that to me though. Maybe to avoid a cliche of breakups? Maybe cause she wasn't comfortable. Maybe there is a different explanation and I got this part wrong.

TODO: Her hard-to-getness might have been really attractive to me. Think about how much of me liking her is down to **getting** her and how much is genuine interest. Think about her perspective: Was I too easy of a target?

Seeing Hanna today.
How did I feel? At first I don't think I felt much at all. It was a bit matter-of-fact. After the swim I very briefly thought about it and thought that I felt kinda good about it. That I wasn't really bothered, or that seeing her was good for me. I thought that I felt like "Ah it's just Hanna", as if I was seeing any other person. 
Later on, I could sense that something is bothering me. Maybe it's fatigue from the swim. But until now I feel a bit down. I think seeing her may have had a subversive effect on me. It's just really hard to pin down what or why exactly that is.

Also, I started getting thoughts about her friend Zoey from Köln. Hanna had told me before that she  likes her a lot and that they have been meeting a lot. I started thinking that she is dating her now. I don't know the significance of this but maybe it made me sad. 
I also think the fact she excused herself so fast was kinda tough. It signaled discomfort on her part, which I thought after we talked things through, shouldn't happen. I was maybe hoping of exchanging a few words. Even a short talk about the swim or any other insignificant thing. Just any show of personality. Maybe to remember how she is. 

One more thing:
How do I deal with this now? I have worked out what happened and a lot of the why it happened. But I haven't thought about how I will deal with it.
There are two solutions. An alluring unhealthy one, and a healthy one.
Alluring unhealthy solution:
I will see her again in many places anyway. Since the main issue was a loss of sexual attraction to me, probably summed up well through this sentence: "She probably felt safe with me — but safe isn’t always _exciting_ or clarifying for people working through attraction trauma." I can find a way to instill that excitement in her when I see her. Being aloof, not really caring about my words and just having fun with things.

Healthy solution:
Start moving on. Let time heal me. "What does this pain _need_, not _why_ is it here?" Maybe it just needs time. Or to be held with kindness. Or witnessed. 


## 🧠 The Alluring Unhealthy Path: _Win Her Back by Being Cool, Detached, Desired_

This is tempting _because_:

- It offers **control** in a situation where you felt powerless.
    
- It promises **validation** — not just from her, but from yourself: “See, I _can_ be what she wants.”
    
- It creates **hope** that the story isn’t over, just paused.
    
- It gives you a **role to play**, which is easier than just sitting with pain.
    

But the emotional price is:

- You’re still orienting your **self-worth** around _her approval_.
    
- You’d be stepping back into a dynamic that already showed you **incompatibility and instability**.
    
- Any validation you get is temporary — because it's built on _performance_, not connection.
    
- You’re likely to end up **disappointed again** — this time not because she didn’t want you, but because you had to _act like someone else_ to maybe get a reaction.
    

This path keeps you emotionally tethered to someone who **wasn’t ready or able** to meet you where you are.

## 💛 The Healthy Path: _Grieve, Heal, Move Forward_

It’s harder in the short-term because:

- There's **no immediate dopamine hit** of attention, flirting, or drama.
    
- It requires you to **accept finality**, even when you still want more.
    
- It means **facing your own pain**, not distracting from it.
    

But the long-term gain is:

- You **reclaim your dignity and power** — not by trying to be what someone else wants, but by standing strong in who _you_ are.
    
- You open the door for **someone who _does_ want you**, and who finds excitement in the safety you offer.
    
- You break the cycle of seeking love through being _less_ of yourself.
    

And crucially:

- **You don’t lose yourself** in the process.

## 🧩 Is There Any Middle Ground?

Sometimes we ask: “Can I do a bit of both?”

Yes — but only if you’re very clear **who you’re doing it for**.

If you bump into her and happen to be light, fun, or mysterious — but you’re being **authentically you**, not a performance — then sure, go ahead. Let her see your growth, but don’t let her be the reason for it.

As soon as you’re changing your behavior to **get a reaction**, you’re stepping back into old wounds.

## ⚖️ Final Thought: What's the Argument?

Yes, there **is** an argument — a _very human one_ — for the first path. But it's not really about her. It's about you trying to reverse a feeling of rejection.

And that’s okay. Wanting to feel wanted is not wrong.

But the second path — the healthy one — is the one that _actually gives you what you need_: healing, integrity, and peace.

Here’s the bottom line:

> ✨ **You don’t need to win someone back who didn’t choose you. You need to keep choosing yourself.** Over and over. Even when it’s hard. Especially then.
