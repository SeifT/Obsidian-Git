Is there a reason why she wants to stay friends?
She has said before that she hates it when she dates someone with the sole purpose of dating, kinda like interviewing someone for a relationship. That it is much better when something develops out of friendship.

Speaking of: Could there be something developing between her and Janis? They both look good. They actually kinda have that "siblings or dating" kinda look to them haha. They seem to be really close. Maybe, probably something has already happened between them.

Questionable trait:
Her complete freedom and ploygamous behaviour. She is like a good looking man, with the power to sleep with anyone they desire. And acts upon it. Except, she is a woman! One who is beautiful at that. It is even easier for her to get whoever she wants.
While there are more big picture questions like the positivity of that in a world where women don't usually have that freedom, do I personally really want that?
It seems like it would have led to problems.

Another question: Would I have been more okay with the thing not working out because of the monogamy vs. polygamy issue? Probably. It would have been more in my control. It would not have stung like rejection does. I still would have been extremely sad about losing her. Since she was such a source of joy for me.

Question:
What did I hope might happen when I saw her again?
I hoped that she would be really warm. Give me affection like she used to. Even bigger, more unrealistic hopes: I hoped she would see me and get sad. That she'd feel regret about her decision. That she'd reconsider it and text me later.

Question:
What part of me feels sad right now? The part that lost her? Or the part that lost the idea of what could have been?
I think when thinking about it over the past two weeks, the moments I felt the saddest in, were when I thought about her laughing, or her smile, or a stupid moment we had. The way she'd look into my eyes. The way it felt looking into hers.
I think there was a part that hoped for something long term, but I was mostly enjoying the present in that time.

The issue was in the end the sex. Is there a way to reverse that? A way to make her reconsider?
Also, it doesn't make complete sense to me. If the issue was indeed sex, why did she break it off after exactly one time. She said she felt really comfortable after the sex. I mean I was very pleasing. She didn't orgasm but I think she still had some fun, no matter how inexperienced I am.
So why would she judge it based on one time. It's always weird the first time anyway. That's really part of what forms a relationship. Learning about each other, growing with each other and adapting to the other person's needs. I can't really come perfect out of the package.

What am I afraid this breakup says about me? And is it really true?
I am afraid that I am not good enough to be loved by someone great. That maybe I am overshooting. Trying with women I don't deserve. There really isn't a pattern there, I have been sought after, but the two most beautiful, intelligent and (from an outsiders perspective) valuable on the dating market women were the two that broke up with me. The other two where it was the opposite, I broke up with them.
I am very empathetic, intelligent and have a good heart. I can also be funny, but I think I lack a bit of the excitement factor. I am not very charismatic either. But with women I usually build up banter really well. Maybe not as well as I thought then. Maybe other men are much funnier, much more alluring and flirty than I am. Thinking about it, that's probably true actually. But I think I am good enough with that in any case. Like there is no glaring deficiency on that front.

Why was the challenging of ideas and thoughts only from her side? Why did I feel like I have to appease her ideals or at least convince her of my ideals, whereas hers came about mostly as tautological?

Update 06.09.2025:
Was just thinking. Maybe it wasn't as I thought, i.e. because she prefers women. Maybe it got serious fast, and in a trajectory that was going towards a monogamous relationship. That, along with the meh sex gave her cold feet, her "komisches Bauchgefühl".
She enjoyed the day we met again. Is she keeping the door open? 


Update 23.09.2025:
**Reality check for fantasies:**
- (1) “She remembers and texts” → Possible? Sure. **Predictable or controllable? No.** Your job isn’t to be ready; it’s to be **okay even if she doesn’t**.
- (2) “Friend’s car-ride persuasion” → You can’t outsource someone’s heart. If a change happens, you’ll hear. **Until then, it’s just a thought.**

Also, I never wrote a note on "why it was not a match", even though that would be very helpful.
So here (This is all very speculative):
1. Her desire of a polygamous relationship, not a monogamous one
2. A fundamental difference in the way we lead our lives. I find the people I love and like clinging on to them. I get the love and life experience I need from and with them. I think that she knows so many people and gets energy from getting to know even more interesting people. 
3. "1." and "2." combined lead to the problem. Because she is not fulfilled by the basis of people around her, and the fact that she meets a lot of new people, admittedly interesting people since she is in cool and I guess intellectual circles, having an experience, perhaps sexual with one of them would always be on the table. (Especially because she has no gender restriction lol)
4. Common issue when I date women from Europe: We have very different issues that are important to us. In Europe, feminism, climate change, social justice, LGBTQ rights are in the foreground. Egypt and the Arab world have completely different priorities, which leads to me also having different priorities. Poverty, freedom of press, freedom of speech, divides of religion, Western whitewashing, orientalism, colonialism both physically and culturally, post-colonialism. Okay I have made the issues I care about seem way more comprehensive and important than hers but the point stands.
	1. While we do align on most views, the discrepancy lies in the level of involvement and the degree of importance.  Because we are both people who are politically conscious and value our principles and views, the lack of involvement or the apathy of one party to the views of the other party would lead to issues.
	2. "1." is debatable of course, since one can argue that it's even cooler like that because we can teach each other about all of the different issues but that would be an idealist's view.
5. I guess the difference in sexual experience was an issue. I don't necessarily see it that way, since I think I could have and would have really wanted to learn along the way, but maybe she doesn't have the patience for that.

Update 27.09.2029:
So I more and more realize that I was acting kinda clingy. Like she was really reciprocating interest but the initiation was very strong from my side. She had mentioned before she gets turned off when a man really wants her (lol), and while she meant that sexually, maybe it extends to generally as well.
