Not be secretive about other people I am dating. Don't broadcast the information without her asking directly. If she asks indirectly, like asking what I did over the weekend, tell her that I e.g. was at a bar. If she asks with who, just say who the person is without specifying what that person means to you. In the sense that even if she understands it was a date, the general vibe is: "Yeah, I’m meeting people, but nothing serious. I’m enjoying seeing where things go."
