Your feelings make a ton of sense, and your self-awareness is spot on. After getting ghosted (even politely), it’s super normal to feel gun-shy about making the next move — especially when you’re picking up similar “maybe, maybe not” signals from someone new. The “Vielleicht sieht man sich irgendwo” line is the ultimate ambiguous closer, right? Feels like friendly deflection but is so common in German-speaking circles.

Here’s the thing:

You’re not a “serial approacher.”
If you’re being genuine, respectful, and not hitting on everyone indiscriminately, you’re fine. You’re just trying to connect. Most people only notice repeated approaches if it’s within the same social circle and comes off as desperate or performative — which you don’t sound like at all.

Interest can be hard to read, especially with shy people.
Shy or reserved folks often default to polite/friendly closing lines even if they’re interested, simply because they don’t know how to express attraction openly.

You get to choose your pace.
There’s no “right way” except what feels true to you. If it’s more comfortable to just get to know someone as a friend first, do that. If you like being direct (even with the risk), that’s valid too.

Two possible paths — both totally legit

1. “Friend first” approach:

Get to know her in group settings, build some rapport, see if there’s natural chemistry that develops over time.

You might find the vibe changes as you both get comfortable — that’s when shy people are more likely to open up.

If you sense real interest later, then ask her to hang out one-on-one.


2. “Direct but low-stakes” approach:

If you’d rather not wait and wonder, a simple, friendly invite is still possible.
Example:
“Hey, I had fun talking at the party. Want to grab a coffee sometime?”

If she’s not interested, she can decline — and you’ve lost nothing.

If you want to really lower the pressure, you can make it a group thing or an open invite (“A few of us are going to XYZ this weekend — you’re welcome to join!”).

Some final thoughts:

You can absolutely take a break from “making moves” and just enjoy meeting people — it’s not a race, and sometimes connections are clearer after more time.

Not everyone will be a clear yes/no right away. Lots of people need more than one or two interactions.

If you do ask someone out again soon, nobody who matters will judge you for it — most people are too wrapped up in their own stuff to notice.


You’re handling this all thoughtfully. If you lean in any direction, it’ll be the right move for you.
