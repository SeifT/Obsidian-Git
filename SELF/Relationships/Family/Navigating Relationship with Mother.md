- **When talking about emotions: Set the tone for the conversation**, to make the other person understand the purpose of the conversation and not draw a conclusion on their own.
	***Example**:*
	_"Before I tell you this, I want you to know that I am doing well. I'm happy, I'm handling things, and I just like to share with you because you're my mother and I value our conversations."_  
	
	This reassures her _before_ her mind jumps to worst-case scenarios.

- **Keep a Balance Between Challenges and Wins**
	If she only hears about difficulties, even if they are minor, it will reinforce her concern. Make sure she also hears about your positive experiences:

- **Give Her a Role, but Redefine It**  
	She might be feeling helpless watching from afar, which worsens her anxiety. If she feels she still has a purpose in your life, it might ease her need to micromanage. Instead of "fixing" things, she can:

	- Share stories about her own challenges and how she handled them
	- Give you advice on small, harmless topics (e.g., a recipe, a travel tip)
	- Feel needed in ways that don’t interfere with your autonomy

	This helps her shift from **"I must intervene"** to **"I am still valued in their life."**
	
- **Recognize the Emotional Shift in the Relationship**
	"I love that you care, but I want you to trust me more—I promise I’ll always come to you if I need you."
	"You’ve raised me to handle life well, and I want you to see that."
