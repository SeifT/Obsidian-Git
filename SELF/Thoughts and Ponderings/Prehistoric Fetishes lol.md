Dormant fetishes that can only be revealed based on the time in which you live.  
So: A caveman having a fucking in cars fetish. There were no cars back then. BUT maybe there was a caveman that was like: "I feel like I'm missing something"

Also on fetishes:  
The more normal your fetish, the weirder it is. By normal I mean "further away from the bedroom". So like having a bike helmet fetish is way weirder than having a foot fetish.
