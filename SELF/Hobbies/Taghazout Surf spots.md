- **Imsouane:**
	- Season: All
	- Level: All
	- Features: Two different spots. 
		- Outside of the bay: Voluminous, fast waves. At the far left (looking at shore) you have right handers. In the middle there are sometimes smaller peaks which are mostly closeouts. To the right there are left handers with less power and volume than the left area. Best time at turnover from high to low tide.
		- Inside the bay: Longboard spot. smaller waves but they go for loooong. Right handers only. There are many breaks that start at the shoulder of the bay, next to the port, and then progressively a few more breaks the more the wave goes right. In winter the wave starts even behind the port, outside of the bay.
	- Personal Notes. Surfed 08.06.2025. Amazing spot!
