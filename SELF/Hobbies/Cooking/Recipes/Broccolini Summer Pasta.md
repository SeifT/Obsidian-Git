### **Instructions:**

1. **Roast the Broccolini:**
    
    - Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
        
    - Toss broccolini with a bit of olive oil, salt, and pepper.
        
    - Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 15–18 minutes, until edges are crisp and stems are tender but snappy. Let cool slightly, then cut into long pieces if desired.
        
2. **Grill the Chicken:**
    
    - Season chicken breasts with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a little lemon zest.
        
    - Grill or pan-sear until golden and just cooked through (about 4–5 min per side).
        
    - Let rest, then slice thinly.
        
3. **Make the Basil-Walnut Pesto:**
    
    - In a food processor: Add basil, spinach, walnuts, garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, and chili flakes. Pulse to chop.
        
    - With the motor running, drizzle in olive oil until creamy but textured.
        
    - Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add more lemon if you want it punchier.
        
4. **Cook the Pasta:**
    
    - Cook pasta in salted water until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water, then drain.
        
5. **Assemble:**
    
    - In a large bowl, toss the hot pasta with pesto, adding reserved pasta water as needed to make it saucy and glossy.
        
    - Fold in cherry tomatoes, olives, and roasted broccolini.
        
    - Top with sliced grilled chicken.
        
    - Finish with a generous shower of Parmigiano Reggiano and extra lemon zest.
        
    - Drizzle with olive oil and scatter a few torn basil leaves for color.
