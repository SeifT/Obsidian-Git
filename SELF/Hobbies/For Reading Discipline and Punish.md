**Questions to constantly ask:**

- What is Foucault arguing _in this specific section_?
- What historical evidence is he using to support his claim?
- How does this relate to what he has argued before?
- What are the implications of this argument?
- Do I find his evidence and reasoning convincing? Why or why not?

**Note-Taking**:

Two-Column Notes. This can be particularly effective for this book:
- **Left Column (Text-Specific):** Note down key quotes, specific historical examples Foucault uses (e.g., the Panopticon, the details of public executions, the rules of the House of Correction), and summaries of his main points within a section. Include page numbers for easy reference.
- **Right Column (Your Analysis and Connections):** In this column, write your interpretations, questions, connections to other parts of the book, potential criticisms, and how Foucault's ideas relate to contemporary society or your own understanding of power.

**Chapter Summaries (After Each Chapter):** After finishing a chapter, write a concise summary of its main argument, the key evidence presented, and how it contributes to the overall thesis of the book. This will help you keep track of the unfolding argument.

Try to connect his abstract arguments to the concrete historical examples he provides.
