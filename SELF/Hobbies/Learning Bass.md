Some tips to improve my bass playing. 
Includes: Hand tension, pressing with pads of fingers instead of only tips and exercises


---

Hand Tension & Clawing: User's fretting hand is tense and "clawed" due to small hands and a tiny pinky finger, making it hard to reach frets in time.

Finger Placement: Rather than pressing with the very tips of fingers, bass players often use the pads or middle sections of fingers, which allows for smoother, more relaxed playing.

Relaxation & Smoothness: Fingers should remain straight and relaxed, not tightly curled. Avoid excessive pressure—just enough for a clean note.

Pinky: Strengthen pinky with exercises like 1-2-3-4 slowly, focusing on pressing lightly.

Thumb Position: Keep thumb behind the neck for natural hand movement.

Hand & Wrist Position: Don’t stretch excessively; shift the hand instead. Keep the wrist in a gentle curve to avoid tension.


These tips are meant to reduce tension, improve finger placement, and help speed up playing.
