### **1. Wheel & Tire Setup**
1. **Remove old tires/tubes if still on.** 
2. **Mount new tires & tubes.**
	1. Install new tires.
	2. Install new tubes (40 mm valve).
	3. Inflate to ~7–8 bar (check tire text) for initial seat.  
3. **Keep wheels *off* for now.**
### **2. Brake Pad Refresh** (with wheels off)
1. Remove wheels. 
2. Sand pads lightly with 120–150 grit until surface is matte.
3. Create slight toe-in (front of pad slightly closer to rim).
4. Clean pads with isopropyl alcohol.
5. Clean rim brake tracks with alcohol + lint-free cloth.
### **3. Cable Replacement (Shift & Brake)**
1. **Remove old cables.**
	1. Shift to smallest cog/chainring.
	2. Release cable anchor bolts at derailleur/brake.
	3. Pull old cables out from shifter side.  
2. **Clean housing.** 
	1. Inspect for kinks, splits, heavy rust (replace if damaged).
	2. Flush generously with isopropyl alcohol until runoff is clean.
	3. Dry completely (compressed air or time).
	4. Optional: one small drop of light oil at each housing end.  
3. **Install new cables.**
	1. Thread from shifter/brake lever side through all housings.
	2. Seat ferrules fully into stops.
4. **Anchor & adjust.**
	1. Pull cables taut, anchor at derailleurs & brakes.
	2. For brakes: give levers a strong squeeze to “set” housing before final tension.
	3. Fine-tune indexing (shift) and brake feel.  
5. **Finish.**
	1. Crimp cable end caps.
	2. Check all levers for smooth feel.
### **4. Install wheels on bike**
1. Insert wheels into dropouts, close quick-release skewers with firm resistance halfway through the close.
2. Adjust brake pads to match new rim brake track height and contact evenly.
3. Spin wheels to confirm no brake rub.
### **5. Chain – Replace or Clean**
1. **Check chain wear** – Use chain checker or measure 12 links = exactly 12".  
2. **If replacing:**
	1. Remove old chain.
	2. Size new chain using big-big + 1 link method.
	3. Install and lube after all drivetrain work.  
3. **If keeping old chain:**
	1. Pre-wipe with dry rag.
	2. Spray degreaser onto rag/toothbrush, clean chain while backpedaling.
	3. Clean between cassette cogs.
	4. Wipe/brush chain while back-pedaling.
	5. Wipe with water-damp rag to remove residue.
	6. Dry fully (rag + spin cranks).
	7. Relube (1 drop/roller), wait 10–15 min, wipe excess.
### **6. Bar Tape**
1. Remove old tape.
2. Install new tape, wrapping from bar ends toward stem. 
3. Secure ends with tape or finishing strips.
### **7. Final Checks**
1. Confirm quick-release skewers tight & closed properly.
2. Check shifting across all gears without skipping.
3. Lightly grease seatpost, pedals, and any bolts adjusted during work.
### **8. First Ride Shakedown**
1. Short 5–10 min test ride near home. Listen for rattles, squeaks, or rubbing.
2. Recheck quick-release skewers, brake pad clearance, and cable anchor bolts after ride.
3. Minor re-index if shifting slightly off.
