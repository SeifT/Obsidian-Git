## **1. Safety First – Initial Inspection**

Before doing any work:

- **Frame & fork check**
    
    - Look for cracks around welds, bottom bracket shell, and where the carbon fork meets the crown.
        
- **Wheels**
    
    - Inspect rims for cracks around spoke holes.
        
    - Check hubs for smooth rotation (no grinding or play).
        
- **Brakes**
    
    - Check that they spring back freely and pads are not hardened or worn to metal.

## **2. Drivetrain & Transmission**

- **Chain**
    
    - Check chain stretch with a chain checker tool — if over 0.75% wear, replace.
        
    - Even if it’s not stretched, clean & lube it.
        
- **Cassette & chainrings**
    
    - Inspect for shark-tooth wear. If badly worn and you replace chain, you might need cassette too.
        
- **Derailleurs**
    
    - Check jockey wheels for smooth spinning.
        
    - Adjust indexing once you replace cables.

## **3. Cables & Housing**

- After 10 years, **replace all cables and housing** (shifter + brake).
    
    - Friction and corrosion are common killers of shifting performance.
        
    - If you’ve never done it, the workshop should have cable cutters and ferrules.

## **4. Wheels & Tires**

- Replace **tires and tubes** (the old ones will be brittle and unsafe).
    
- Check spoke tension, true both wheels.
    
- Grease wheel hub bearings if you have the skill (Cup & Cone hubs especially need it).
    

---

## **5. Brakes**

- Replace brake pads if hard, cracked, or uneven.
    
- Clean braking surfaces on rims with isopropyl alcohol.
    

---

## **6. Cockpit**

- **Bar tape** → Old tape will likely be brittle — replace for comfort & grip.
    
- **Headset** → Check for smooth turning without play; re-grease bearings if needed.

## **7. Bottom Bracket**

- Spin the cranks — should be smooth, no grinding.  
    If rough, open & regrease or replace (Chorus BBs are serviceable).
    

---

## **8. Lubrication**

- Lightly grease:
    
    - Seatpost (prevents seizing)
        
    - Pedal threads
        
    - Skewer threads
        
- Lube the chain after a deep clean.
    

---

## **9. First Ride Checks**

- After your first short ride:
    
    - Retighten stem, crank bolts, and quick-releases.
        
    - Re-check brake pad alignment.
        
    - Fine-tune derailleur indexing.
