### Make swaps a 60–90 second job

Do these once, then future swaps are quick:

1. **Match the drivetrains**
    

- Put the **same-speed, same-brand cassette** on both wheelsets (ideally same model & tooth counts).
    
- Install any **required spacers** for your freehub/cassette (Mavic hubs sometimes need one for 10-speed on 11-speed bodies—use what the cassette/hub specifies).
    
- Set your derailleur indexing **perfect** on one wheel, then test the other. If the cassette sits a hair in/out, add a **thin cassette shim** or re-index once and stick with it.
    

2. **Keep tire size the same**
    

- Run the **same tire width** (e.g., 25 mm on both). That keeps brake clearances and ride feel consistent and avoids brake readjustment.
    

3. **Brake setup (rim brakes)**
    

- Center the caliper to the wheel that’s **furthest off**; aim to have **no pad rub** with either wheel.
    
- Use the caliper’s **barrel adjuster** for tiny tweaks after a swap. Mark your “sweet spot” with a paint pen if you like.
    

_(Disc brakes: make sure rotor sizes match; if you get rub on one wheel, rotor shims or a one-time caliper align usually solves it.)_

4. **Chain wear**
    

- If the cassettes wear at different rates, you can rotate **two chains** (each “married” to a cassette) to prevent skipping.
    

5. **Quick-release/thru-axle consistency**
    

- Set the QR nut (or axle torque) so both wheels seat **identically** in the dropouts. A tiny mark on the lever position helps.
    

### Is it “worth it” for monthly tours?

- **Yes**—if the above is done, the swap is literally a minute: open brake (if needed), wheel out, wheel in, close QR/axle, quick spin, maybe a click or two on the barrel adjuster.
    
- **Performance:** Ksyriums are generally lighter/stiffer than a typical CXP33 build, so you’ll feel it most on climbs and accelerations. The **biggest real-world gain** often comes from **tires**—a fast, supple tire on the Ksyriums will be more noticeable than the rims alone.
    

### Simple routine on swap day

1. Shift to smallest cog, swap wheels.
    
2. Close QR/axle.
    
3. Spin wheel: check pad/rotor rub.
    
4. One or two clicks on the derailleur barrel if needed. Done.
    

If you set it up once, swapping monthly is absolutely worth it. If you ever keep needing big brake or indexing changes, that’s a sign something (cassette match, spacers, rotor alignment) needs a one-time fix.
