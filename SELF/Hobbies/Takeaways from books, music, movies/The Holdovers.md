# Father and Son
The whole father-son dynamic between Mr Hunham and Angus got me feeling very melancholic. As my father is aging and I see and understand more about him and how he is, I just feel like I want to give him a big hug. I live abroad now and have a lot going on in my life. I don't want life (and him) to pass me by while I am away. I really would love it so much if I could do something nice for him. Like send him on a nice trip, or maybe go together. He hasn't traveled in such a long time. Mainly because he has been paying so much money to finance me and my siblings through university. Uni has taken a long time for me. And it's still at least a year until I start working full time. So I can't really afford to plan a trip for him and it breaks my heart. There was this one scene, where Mr Hunham is watching Angus in the ice rink. A song by Yusuf (Cat Stevens) plays. My father used to sing Father and Son by him to us a lot as kids. While it wasn't the exact same song I started crying as soon as he started singing. I didn't know I had all of these feelings about this in me so I was a bit surprised. I am on vacation back home right now and I want to spend as much time as I can with him for the last few days I have here.

One take away from this:
Maybe I should thank him for all he's done over the years for us. Even if not with a trip or whatever today, just with *words*.

Angus:
	"See, when you say it that way, and throw in some pornography, it's a lot easier to understand."
Mr Hunham (takes off glasses and chuckles):
	"Hmhm, okay"
Angus:
	"You should try doing more of that in class and less yelling. You know most of the kids dislike you, pretty much hate you. Teachers too. You know that right?"
Mr Hunham:
	Dejected and nods sadly. The look on his face. Giamatti captured that feeling of regret and failure perfectly. Hunham lives in denial about his ways in life and when faced about the consequences of his insecurities and shortcomings, all he can do is stand there and take it. 

# Angus' Confessions of Ache
The scene where Angus opens up to Mr Hunham about how he perceives himself and his shortcoming, the cards he's been dealt in life. 
Tears in his eyes. Angus feels lost. A silent plea for validation, for understanding. He needed the support of a father, to tell him it's going to be okay. Complete honesty. This is the point where he felt Mr Hunham would be able to provide that for him. It's a beautiful, rare moment of a man opening his heart to another.

Mr Hunham:
	"You're your own man!
	Man? No. You're just a kid. You're just *beginning*. And you're smart... And you've got time to turn things around. Yes I know; I know that Greeks had the idea, uh, that the steps you take to avoid your fate are the very steps that lead you to it, that but that's just a literary conceit. In real life, your history does not have to dictate your destiny."
