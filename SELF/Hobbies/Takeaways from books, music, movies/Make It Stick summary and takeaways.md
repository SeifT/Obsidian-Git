# The gist (2-minute summary)

- Learning that _feels_ easy (re-reading, cruising through notes) is mostly an **illusion of mastery**.
- Memory and understanding grow when you add **desirable difficulties**: effortful **retrieval**, **spacing** over time, and **mixing** (interleaving) different topics/problems.
- **Test yourself to learn** (not just to check): frequent low-stakes quizzes, flashcards, and “closed-book recalls” strengthen memory and reveal gaps.
- **Elaborate** new ideas in your own words, tie them to what you know, use **concrete examples** and **dual coding** (words + visuals).
- Make **mistakes early and often**—then correct them. Errors + feedback turbocharge retention
- Keep **calibrating**: compare your self-judgment with objective checks (quizzes, problems) so you don’t overestimate mastery.

# What to do differently starting today

## 1) Replace re-reading with **retrieval**
- After a class or reading, close everything and write down: “What were the 3–5 key ideas? How do they connect?”
- Build or grab practice questions. For definitions/concepts: flashcards. For problem-solving: end-of-chapter problems or past papers.
- Flashcard rule: answer out loud or on paper before flipping; mark “easy / hard” to control spacing.
## 2) **Space** your practice
- Small, repeated sessions beat cramming. Use this simple interval ladder for new items: **Day 0 → Day 2 → Day 6 → Day 16 → Day 35**.
- For flashcards, move “easy” ones to longer intervals; keep “hard” ones short. Ten to fifteen minutes of spaced cards daily is enough to notice gains.
## 3) **Interleave** (mix) topics and problem types
- Instead of doing 20 of the same problem, rotate: A-B-C-A-C-B (e.g., derivatives → limits → integrals → derivatives…).
- In concept courses, alternate chapters/ideas in a single session. This improves discrimination: you learn **when** to use which method.
## 4) **Elaborate & generate** before you’re “ready”
- Before reading a solution, **predict** the approach. Even a wrong attempt helps.
- Explain a concept to a blank page or a “rubber duck.” Use “because…” and connect to prior knowledge (“This mechanism is like …”).
## 5) **Use concrete examples & dual coding**
- For each abstract idea, list **two concrete examples** (one typical, one tricky edge-case).
- Sketch simple diagrams, flows, or timelines; pair them with a few words. Redraw from memory later.
## 6) **Reflect briefly**
- End of study block (2–3 minutes): write
    1. What did I learn?
    2. Where did I struggle?
    3. What will I do next time?
- This cements learning and informs the next session.
## 7) **Calibrate with frequent checks**
- Weekly: a mini “exam” under timed, closed-book conditions. Grade quickly; list errors; schedule them back into your queue.

# A plug-and-play study loop
**Daily (30–60 min total, split if needed)**
1. **Warm-up recall (5 min):** Yesterday’s topics—write from memory.
2. **Spaced review (10–15 min):** Flashcards / key problems due today.
3. **New learning (15–25 min):** Read/watch actively; stop every few pages to self-quiz.
4. **Generation (5–10 min):** Do 1–3 mixed problems or explain the idea without notes.
5. **Reflect (2–3 min):** Log struggles + next steps.

**Weekly**
- **Cumulative quiz (20–40 min):** Mixed topics, closed-book, timed. 
- **Error log pass (10 min):** Tag errors: concept, procedure, or careless. Add one example of each to next week’s mix.

# Do / Don’t
**Do**
- Test to learn (flashcards, practice problems, one-pagers from memory).
- Space and mix practice.
- Embrace effort, mistakes, and feedback.
- Build your own examples and visuals.

**Don’t**
- Rely on re-reading/highlighting as your main tactic.
- Grind one type of problem in a row.
- Judge learning by fluency (“it feels familiar”) rather than performance after a delay.

# Two fast start plans
**If your exam is < 2 weeks away**
- 60–90 min/day: 50% mixed practice under mild time pressure, 30% targeted fixes from error log, 20% fresh content.
- Every other day: timed mini-set (20–30 min) of past questions.

**If you have > 1 month**
- 30–45 min/day: build spaced deck + mixed problems now; do weekly cumulative quizzes; expand with elaboration notes and diagrams.
