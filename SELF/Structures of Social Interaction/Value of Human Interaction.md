Thinking about the *value* I provide someone in any given conversation.
Is human interaction commodified to the point that we need to extract *value* from any given conversation with someone in order for that to be time well spent.

What exactly can *value* in conversation be?
- **Entertainment/Laughter**
- **Abstract information Exchange.** Information that is either more big picture, or not particularly useful at this point in time. This is true as long as the information being exchanged is interesting to the receiving person.
- **Concrete Information Exchange.** Information that can be used in the immediate future by the receiving person
- **Emotional Support.** Offering sympathy, understanding, or just listening
- **Social Validation.** For some people this can provide a lot of value. 
- ***Needs Review.*** **Social Bonding/Relationship Building.** Conversations with the purpose of building or maintaining a relationship (platonic or romantic), so long as this relationship is of interest to one or more parties.

Types of conversation that provide little, minimal,  or no value to the recipient:
- Self Expression. Though if performed by very inspired or passionate individuals it can provide value. **Note:** Not necessarily that the person is actually expressing something of value. In many cases it could be that the person is highly respected, sometimes under false pretenses, and therefore their opinion carries more weight.
