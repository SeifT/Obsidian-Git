### Summary

Explored the idea that people may value validation of their existing experiences more than the pursuit of new ones, using the popularity of music reaction videos on YouTube as a case study.
### Key Points

- **Music Reaction Videos:**
    
    - These videos are most popular when featuring songs/albums viewers already know.
        
    - Viewers seem to watch to see their tastes and opinions validated by someone else, rather than out of curiosity for new music.
        
    - The core appeal is not the music itself, but the alignment between the creator’s reaction and the viewer’s own feelings.
        
- **Psychological Underpinnings:**
    
    - **Validation:** Human beings have a basic need for social validation, reinforcing their beliefs, tastes, and experiences.
        
    - **Familiarity Bias:** Familiar experiences provide comfort and require less cognitive effort (cognitive ease).
        
    - **Social Proof:** Watching familiar content creates a sense of belonging and social connection.
        
- **Wider Social Application:**
    
    - This validation-seeking behavior extends beyond YouTube or music.
        
    - In conversations, people tend to bond more over shared, familiar experiences than over introducing something entirely new.
        
    - Referencing a beloved, familiar movie resonates more than suggesting an unknown one.
        
- **Academic Backing:**
    
    - Supported by psychological concepts such as the _mere exposure effect_ (preference for familiar things) and _confirmation bias_ (seeking information that affirms existing beliefs).
        
- **Counterpoint:**
    
    - The format of reaction videos naturally lends itself to validation, so this effect might be especially pronounced here.
    - Watching a reaction video of music you don't know is not the common way to have a novel experience. People will probably rather just listen to the music themselves, not watch someone listen to it.
    - People seeking novelty may directly engage with new experiences, rather than through someone else’s reaction.
        

### Conclusion

The desire for validation through familiar experiences significantly shapes both content consumption and social interaction. While validation is powerful and comforting, balancing it with openness to new experiences is essential for personal and cultural growth.
